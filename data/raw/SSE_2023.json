Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Accounting Metric\nCode Accounting metric SSE disclosure 2022/23\nIF-EU-110a.1 (1) Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered under (2) emissions-limiting regulations, and (3) emissions-reporting regulations SSE’s generation activities in the UK are subject to the UK ETS and the carbon price support and in Ireland they are subject to the EU ETS (see page 26 of this report\nand page 51 of the Annual Report 2023. SSE is required to report its GHG emissions and energy consumption in the UK through the Companies (Directors’ Report)\nand Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018 and the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) requirements. Information\ndisclosed in the accompanyng data and perfromance tables (available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting), alongside pages 49 to 51 of SSE’s Annual Report 2023\nrepresent SSE’s disclosure against these requirements.\nIF-EU-110a.2 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with power deliveries As of January 2020, SSE Energy Services, the retail division of the SSE Group, was sold to OVO Energy. This ended the direct supply of electricity from SSE to\nhousehold customers in Great Britain. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) maintain responsibility for the distribution of electricity across central southern\nEngland and the north of Scotland, as well as the electricity transmission network in the north of Scotland. Details of the emissions associated with the losses within\nit’snetworks are dislcosed in the accompanyng data and perfromance tables (available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting) .\nIF-EU-110a.3 Discussion of long-term and short-term strategy or plan to manage Scope 1 emissions, emissions reduction targets, and an analysis of Two of SSE’s science-based carbon targets cover SSE’s scope 1 GHG emissions. Discussion on trends and progress against these targets can be found on pages 20\nperformance against those targets and 21 of the Sustainability Report 2023 and page 51 of the Annual Report 2023.\nIF-EU-110a.4 (1) Number of customers served in markets subject to renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and (2) percentage fulfillment of RPS target by market SSE’s customer facing businesses only serve customers in the GB market and the island of Ireland Single Electricty Market. Both these energy markets have mature\ncarbon reduction and renewable support frameworks. In Ireland, there are government targets on particular forms of renewable energy (for example, 7GW of offshore\nwind by 2030) and, in the UK, renewable targets support statutory carbon budgets. Neither market has standards that mean electricity generators must secure a\nproportion of their portfolio of energy generation from renewable sources.\nIF-EU-120a.1 Air emissions of the following pollutants: (1) NOx (excluding NO), (2) SOx, (3) particulate matter (PM10), (4) lead (Pb), and (5) mercury (Hg); SSE discloses NOx, SOx, PM10 and Mercury air emissions on page pages 80 and 87 of this report and page 54 of the Annual Report 2023 and in the accompanyng\n2\npercentage of each in or near areas of dense population data and perfromance tables (available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting). Data from other air emissions is reported to the environmental regulator and, while this\ninformation can be accessed through a request to the regulator, SSE is working to disclose it more readily to its stakeholders in future.\nIF-EU-140a.1 (1) Total water withdrawn, (2) total water consumed, percentage of each in regions with High or Extremely High Baseline Water Stress SSE depends on water in various ways across its operations, from use in electricity generation to an amenity in its buildings. SSE provides information on its water\nmanagement approach and its operations in relation to water stressed areas on page 87 of this report and page 53 of the Annual Report 2023, alongside a detailed\nbreakdown of water use data in the accompanyng data and perfromance tables (available at www.sse.com/sustainability/reporting).\nIF-EU-140a.2 Number of incidents of non-compliance associated with water quantity and/or quality permits, standards, and regulations In 2022/23, SSE had eight minor permit breaches in relation to water quantity and/or quality permits. Immediate action to rectify the non-compliance was undertaken\nand the environmental regulator notified in each case. Investigations were completed following these events and actions taken to prevent reoccurrence.\nIF-EU-140a.3 Description of water management risks and discussion of strategies and practices to mitigate those risks Detailed description of the strategies and pratcices SSE has in place to mitigate water management risks is provided in SSE’s CDP Water Programme response, which is\npublicly available on its website at sse.com/sustainability\nIF-EU-150a.1 Amount of coal combustion residuals (CCR) generated, percentage recycled N/A - SSE closed its last remaining coal-fired power plant in March 2020.\nIF-EU-150a.2 Total number of coal combustion residual (CCR) impoundments, broken down by hazard potential classification and structural integrity assessment N/A - SSE closed its last remaining coal-fired power plant in March 2020\nIF-EU-240a.1 Average retail electric rate for (1) residential, (2) commercial, and (3) industrial customers Information will be made available in 2023/24.\nIF-EU-240a.2 Typical monthly electric bill for residential customers for (1) 500 kWh and (2) 1,000 kWh of electricity delivered per month Information will be made available in 2023/24.\nIF-EU-240a.3 Number of residential customer electric disconnections for non-payment, percentage reconnected within 30 days Information will be made available in 2023/24.\nIF-EU-240a.4 Discussion of impact of external factors on customer affordability of electricity, including the economic conditions of the service territory SSE recognises the challenging circumstances faced by energy consumers, exascerbated by the cost-of-living crisis. In response, SSE Airtricity supported its customers\nthrough a combination of keeping tariffs as low as possible, a price freeze targeted at financially vulnerable consumers and customer support funds. More details can\nbe found on pages 64 of the Annual Report 2023, and page 32 of the Sustainability Report 2023.\nIF-EU-320a.1 (1) Total recordable incident rate (TRIR), (2) fatality rate, and (3) near miss frequency rate (NMFR) See the accompanyng data and perfromance tables (available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting) for SSE’s safety performance, as well as page 75 of the\nSustainability Report 2023 and pages 63 and 163 to 164 of SSE’s Annual Report 2023.\nIF-EU-420a.1 Percentage of electric utility revenues from rate structures that (1) are decoupled and (2) contain a lost revenue adjustment mechanism (LRAM) Not applicable in the UK and Irish electricity systems.\nIF-EU-420a.2 Percentage of electric load served by smart grid technology With the smart meter roll out continuing in Great Britain, there are now 1,845,807 smart meters connected to SSEN Distribution’s network that can ‘communicate’ to\nSSEN’s system. This means that 50% of all SSEN’s supply points have communicable and smart capability*.\nIF-EU-420a.3 Customer electricity savings from efficiency measures, by market See pages 34 to 38 for details of SSE’s fuel poverty and energy efficiency support.\nIF-EU-540a.1 Total number of nuclear power units, broken down by U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Action Matrix Column N/A - SSE does not operate nuclear generation.\nIF-EU-540a.2 Description of efforts to manage nuclear safety and emergency preparedness N/A - SSE does not operate nuclear generation.\nIF-EU-550a.1 Number of incidents of non-compliance with physical and/or cybersecurity standards or regulations SSE has robust processes and practices in place to manage cybersecurity and its datacentres are certified to ISO27001 for information security. SSE also has a suite of\nmandatory ethics and compliance training modules which all employees are required to complete, which includes Cyber Security eLearning module. SSE discloses\nthe number of material or regulatory reportable incidents caused by cyber security breaches of SSE systems in the accompanyng data and perfromance tables\n(available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting).\nIF-EU-550a.2 (1) System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), (2) System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), and (3) Customer Average A comparable indicator for GB is the Customer Interruptions and Customer Minutes Lost on SSE’s electricity distribution network. See the accompanyng data and\nInterruption Duration Index (CAIDI), inclusive of major event days perfromance tables (available at sse.com/sustainability/reporting) for data.\nTable 2.
