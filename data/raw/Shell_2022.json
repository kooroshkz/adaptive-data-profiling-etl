It has also triggered instability in global energy markets and other sectors. Energy and\nfood prices have risen, causing inflation to spiral in many countries.\nOur first response to the invasion was to safeguard our staff in Ukraine and support our people in Russia. We also announced our intention to\nwithdraw from our Russian oil and gas activities in a phased manner, aligned with government guidance. We worked with organisations in\nUkraine and neighbouring countries to provide humanitarian aid. By the end of 2022, we had donated $74 millionto help the people of\nUkraine.\nAs the war caused disruption to energy supplies, we worked to ensure that people received the energy they need to keep economies running\nand electricity flowing. This included delivering a record 194 cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe in 2022 – almost five times our\nusual average. I am proud of the way Shell staff in the UK and Norway, among many others, also stepped up to produce the oil and gas Europe\nneeds.\nWe provided help for those struggling with the rising cost of living. In the UK, for example, we announced a £50 millionpackage to support\nvulnerable energy consumers, and donated millions of pounds to charities to help households pay their energy bills. And in the Netherlands, we\nare contributing to a government-backed emergency fund for the same purpose.\nThe recent devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria affected many Shell people and their families, although mercifully no staff were injured.\nShell has supported relief efforts with the provision of fuel, and chemicals to make foam mattresses and hand sanitiser. We have also made aid\ndonations worth several million dollars, including matching donations made by our staff around the world.\nBalanced transition\nThe energy and cost of living crises have highlighted the need for a balanced energy transition: one in which the world achieves net-zero\nemissions, while still providing a secure and affordable supply of energy. We expect that LNG will play an important role in such a transition. It\nprovides a critical supply of energy today, and it produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal when used to generate electricity.\nIn 2022, we made significant investments to increase production of LNG and reduce emissions from the process. We joined two major projects in\nQatar, for example. Both will use carbon capture and storage, helping us to offer customers LNG with a lower carbon footprint. We also took a\nfinal investment decision to develop the Rosmari-Marjoram gas project in Malaysia, which will be mainly powered by renewable energy.\nNet-zero emissions\nAs we invest in the energy needed today, our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our\nstrategy. We are making good progress. By the end of 2022, we had reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 30% compared with\n2016 on a net basis, more than halfway towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030.\nWe have also made progress in supporting our customers in reducing their own emissions, with further investments in wind, solar, biofuels,\nhydrogen, electric vehicle charging, carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions.\nFor example, we won bids with our partners to build four offshore wind farms in Europe and the USA, which together have the potential to\ngenerate 7.3 gigawatts of power. We acquired Indian solar developer Sprng Energy. And in 2023, we completed the acquisition of Nature\nEnergy of Denmark, which is Europe’s biggest producer of renewable natural gas made from agricultural, industrial and household waste. In\nNigeria, we acquired solar provider Daystar Power, which provides reliable power to commercial and industrial customers.\nIn total, around 41% of our annual spending on research and development goes on projects that contribute to decarbonisation.\n02 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

This was reinforced by both United Nations conferences on climate change (COP27) and biodiversity (COP15) in 2022.\nBiodiversity, water, circular economy and waste, and air quality: these are the four areas we focus on in our commitments to respect nature.\nFor instance, we are working to help end plastic waste in the environment. By the end of 2022, more than 30% of Shell-owned service stations\nhad eliminated unnecessary single-use plastic and almost 40% had completely removed single-use plastic bags.\nIn 2022, we announced plans to increase our global production of pyrolysis oil, made from hard-to-recycle plastics otherwise destined for landfill\nor incineration, by building a new pyrolysis oil upgrader in the Netherlands. Pyrolysis oil can replace traditional feedstock in our chemical plants.\nPowering lives\nShell provides vital energy for homes, businesses and transport. Every year we generate jobs, revenues and taxes in the countries where we\noperate. In 2022, we employed around 93,000 people in more than 70 countries and spent about $41.5 billionon goods and services, 83% of\nwhich we purchased locally in the country of operation. Globally, we paid more than $13 billionto governments in taxes.\nOur enterprise development programmes promote entrepreneurship, innovation and meaningful employment in our host countries. In 2022, Shell\nLiveWIRE trained around 2,685 people and helped create more than 2,170 jobs in 20 countries, while Shell StartUp Engine supported 50 start-\nups in areas such as renewable energy and electric mobility.\nWhile we know there is still much more to do, we are working to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. For\nexample, almost one-third of our senior leadership and just under half of our graduate hires are women.\nWe respect human rights in our business and work hard to ensure that our joint-venture partners and supply chains follow the same principles.\nWe also continue to support theUNGlobal Compact’s corporate governance principles on human rights, environmental protection, anti-\ncorruption and better labour practices.\nSafety and our core values\nAlthough we continue to make progress in safety across our operations and within our industry, we have not been able to eliminate fatal\naccidents involving Shell employees and contractors. I am saddened to report that two of our contractor colleagues died in 2022, one in\nNigeria and one in Pakistan.\nFinally, on a personal note, I am proud to be sharing with you this, my first Shell Sustainability Report asCEO. This report shows what we have\nachieved so far in our work to be a sustainable business. We aim to do this work responsibly, with discipline and at pace to make a positive\ndifference.\nWael Sawan\nChief Executive Officer\nMore in this reportSustainability at Shell|Our journey to achieving net zero|Our approach to respecting nature|Providing access to energy\nMore on Shell websitesOur strategy: Powering Progress\n03 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

They influence the decisions made and actions taken across Shell.\nThe Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) is one of four standing committees of the Board of Directors of Shell plc. The\noverall role of SESCo is to assist the Board in reviewing the policies, practices, targets and performance of Shell, primarily with respect to safety,\nenvironment including climate change, and broader sustainability.\nIn 2022, SESCo held five meetings. The topics discussed in depth by the Committee included personal and process safety, environmental issues,\nShell’s energy transition targets, remuneration metrics and the challenges faced by Shell companies in Nigeria.\nThe Committee also reviewed wider matters of public concern such as plastic waste, methane emissions, the flaring of natural gas, water scarcity,\njust transition, human rights, diversity and inclusion, and access to energy in low- and middle-income countries. The Committee engaged with\nexternal stakeholders on the topic of nature-based solutions and gained valuable insights on how Shell’s approach is perceived.\nSESCo continued to monitor Shell’s approach to the health of its employees and contractors, in terms of mental well-being in particular. The\nCommittee also continued to review the security risks faced by Shell and how these risks are being proactively managed.\nRead more aboutSESCoand how Shell manages sustainability atwww.shell.com/sustainability/our-approach/governanceand in our\n2022 Annual Report.\nMore in this reportOur journey to achieving net zero|Our approach to safety|Energy transition|Our approach to respecting nature\nMore on Shell websitesOur strategy: Powering Progress|Board of Directors|Sustainability governance\n05 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

This element, vested at 180% of target based on performance to the end of 2022, reflects our progress in\ntransitioning towards a lower-carbon future.

This feedback has been considered by Shell in producing the final version of the report.\nIn 2021, Shell significantly changed its approach to sustainability reporting in order to focus more on the data and less on qualitative and\ncontextual information, which is now referenced on its website. This has resulted in a far more concise and logical report with links to\nfurther information located on Shell.com. The panel has not reviewed this additional information as it is not within our remit.\nThe panel welcomes this more concise approach which recognises the need to provide succinct, digestible information to stakeholders\nwhile giving them a brief explanation of context and links to further details. Following the panel’s feedback last year that the 2021 report\ncould have included more context, the panel noted an improvement in the balance between data and context over the previous year. We\nencourage Shell to continue to find ways of achieving this, as qualitative information helps shine light on the significance of the figures.\nWe note that Shell also presents some data in graphic form in order to illustrate progress on strategic priorities over time. The panel\nwelcomed the inclusion of sections on topical issues such as the war in Ukraine and the cost of living. It also noted that the section on\nRespecting nature was more informative and specific – a trend the panel hopes will continue.\nThe panel felt that more could be done to succinctly summarise progress on targets over the year as well as any changes to significant\nissues. This would assist in identifying what progress had been made since the previous year. In addition, more cross-referencing of topics,\nsuch as how human rights relate to supply chain, climate change and biodiversity, would help stakeholders better understand linkages and\nwhat Shell is doing to manage these topics. Information related to the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures could be leveraged in the\nreport.\nThe panel recommends that Shell look to provide further information and data on the following:\nenergy affordability and accessibility;\nthe environmental, social and governance risks involved in the transition to renewable solutions (including solar) and in connection with\nbiodiversity;\noffsets, including a breakdown and how this relates to the overall strategy;\nstakeholder engagements, particularly those related to achieving a just transition;\ninvolvement with the Science Based Targets initiative’s social aspects, including inclusion on the social return on investment created; and\nhow Shell has reviewed and prioritised its salient human rights risks.\"\nReport Review Panel\nJanuary 31, 2023\nMore in this reportSustainability at Shell|About our data|Our standards and policies|GRI table\nMore on Shell websitesOur strategy: Powering Progress|Voluntary reporting standards and ESG ratings\n10 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

Our strategy and actions reflect our values and principles.\nTax revenues enable governments to pay for public services, such as education, health care and transport. In 2022, Shell paid $68.2 billionto\ngovernments: we paid $13.4 billionincorporate income taxesand $8.2 billionin governmentroyalties, and collected $46.6 billioninexcise\nduties, sales taxes and similar levies on our fuel and other products on behalf of governments.\nWe also made other payments to governments, including $15.1 billioninproduction entitlements, $2.6 billioninfeesand $221 millionin\nbonuses.\nNew taxes, such as the EU solidarity contribution and the UK Energy (Oil and Gas) Profits Levy, were introduced in 2022.\nShell publishes a Tax Contribution Report annually which sets out the corporate income tax that Shell companies paid in countries and locations\nwhere they have a taxable presence. Our latestTax Contribution Reportincludes a breakdown of our total tax contribution in 21 countries where\nwe have key business activities, an increase from five in the previous year. We hope to expand this disclosure to include our other tax jurisdictions\nin the future.\nWe regularly engage with policymakers to support the development of tax rules and regulations based on sound tax policy principles. In this\nway, we hope to contribute to the development of fair, effective and stable tax systems. We also provide constructive input to industry groups\nand international organisations, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the B Team Responsible Tax Working Group and the\ninternational business network Business atOECD.\nFor instance, Shell has worked with the largest employers’ organisation in the Netherlands, VNO-NCW, on an initiative to improve tax\ngovernance and transparency for companies whose securities are listed in that country. In May 2022, VNO-NCW published the Tax\nGovernance Code (TGC), which Shell helped initiate and develop.

Also in May 2022, Shell’s share in the Gydan energy exploration venture was transferred to our joint-venture\npartner, GazpromNeft. Gydan is in the exploration phase with no production.\nIn September 2021, Shell signed a binding novation agreement to take over a GasTerra gas supply contract with Gazprom Export LLC\n(Gazprom), with the transfer to take effect from October 1, 2022. Upon transfer, a payable to Gazprom was recorded with a corresponding\nreceivable from GasTerra. The gas supply contract terminated in December 2022.\nOn March 3, 2023, Shell announced that it had completed the sale of its interest in Salym Petroleum Development Limited Liability Company to\na subsidiary of GazpromNeft for which an agreement was signed on December 22, 2022.\nShell holds a 27.5% interest (minus one share) in Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd (SEIC). On June 30, 2022, a Russian Presidential\nDecree was passed requiring the transfer of all licences, rights and obligations of SEIC into a newly created Russian company (LLC) that would\nassume the rights and obligations of SEIC. The decree stated that the foreign shareholders would be invited to apply for shares in that entity\nequivalent to their shareholding in SEIC. Shell formally advised the Russian Federation that it would not apply for shares in the LLC, that it\nobjected to the purported transfers from SEIC to the LLC and that it reserved all rights and remedies.\nRead more about our withdrawal from Russian oil and gas activities inNote 6in our 2022 Annual Report.\n14 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

We work to keep our retail sites open in Ukraine and vital\nenergy supplies moving. Shell only operates in territories controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. We have also provided support to our staff in\nRussia as they faced the uncertainty of Shell’s withdrawal by, for instance, transferring employees of Shell Neft to the new owner.\nBy the start of 2023, the overall amount of our humanitarian donations for the Ukraine war had reached $74 million. Our focus has been to\nsupport the people of Ukraine by working with aid organisations in Ukraine and in bordering countries, where refugees have headed in their\nmillions.\nAs part of our initial efforts in Ukraine and Poland after the invasion, we pledged nearly $11 millionto several humanitarian and aid\norganisations in Ukraine and Poland, of which $3 millionwas humanitarian aid to our global disaster relief partner, Mercy Corps, to help meet\nthe immediate needs of those affected by the war in Ukraine. In addition, Shell has matched employee donations to Mercy Corps.\nIn March 2022, we purchased a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel. Despite being made with security of\nsupplies at the forefront of our thinking and being in compliance with applicable laws, we quickly recognised that it was not the right decision\nand apologised.

We aim to do no harm to people and to have no leaks across our operations. We call this our\nGoal Zero ambition.\nWe seek to improve safety by focusing on the three areas where the safety risks associated with our activities are highest: personal, process and\ntransport. We strive to reduce risks and to minimise the potential impact of any incident, with a particular emphasis on the risks with the most\nserious consequences if something goes wrong.\nIn 2020, we started a multi-year process of refreshing our approach to safety for all employees and contractors. In 2022, as part of this\napproach, we focused on conducting detailed change impact assessments across the Shell Group to assess the extent to which our new safety\nprinciples are being integrated. We completed 49 of 52 assessments of assets, projects, functions and businesses within Shell (we aim to\ncomplete the remaining assessments in 2023). In addition, seven non-operated ventures elected to embed elements of our refreshed approach to\nsafety in their improvement plans.\nWe work closely with our contractors to build a strong safety culture at the frontline. In 2022, we completed construction of the Shell Polymers\nMonaca polyethylene production facility in Pennsylvania, USA, with more than67 millionexposure hours without fatality or serious injury. During\nthe building of a floating production storage and offloading vessel for our Shell-operated Penguins field (Shell interest 50%) in the UK North Sea,\nthe China Offshore Oil Engineering Company’s fabrication yard in China achieved more than16 millionhours without fatality or serious injury.\nAs of January 1, 2022, we have adopted the industry Life-Saving Rules of the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers. During the year,\nmandatory e-learning on the new rules was completed by around 126,000 staff and contractors.\nRead more about our approach to safety and how we work with our contractors atwww.shell.com/sustainability/safety/our-approach.\nMore in this reportPreparing for emergencies|Letter from the CEO\nMore on Shell websitesPowering Progress – transitioning to net-zero emissions|Safety|HSSE materials for contractors\n15 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

SPDC, as the corporate entity,\nowns 30% of the JV.\nIn 2022, about 88% of the oil spills of more than 100 kilograms from the SPDC-operated facilities were caused by the illegal activities of third\nparties. In 2022, the volume of crude oil spills of more than 100 kilograms caused by sabotage was around 0.6 thousand tonnes (75 incidents),\ncompared with around 3.3 thousand tonnes (106 incidents) in 2021. The decreased number of incidents in 2022 correlates with a shutdown of\nproduction for about six months because of an unprecedented increase of crude oil theft from the Trans Niger Pipeline, which is operated by\nSPDCon behalf of the SPDC JV. SPDC continues to work with the government security agencies to maintain surveillance and address illegal\nactivities of third parties, primarily along the SPDCJVpipeline and its operational areas.\nBy the end of 2022, a total of 311 steel cages had been installed to protect wellheads, including 38 that had been upgraded with CCTV. This\ncompared with a total of 283 installed cages at the end of 2021.

In 2022, around 27 kilometres of pipelines and flow lines were replaced.\nRegardless of the cause of a spill, SPDC cleans up and remediates areas affected by spills originating from its facilities. With operational spills, it\npays compensation to affected people and communities. In 2022, the time needed to complete the recovery of free-phase oil – oil that forms a\nseparate layer and is not mixed with water or soil – remained at around one week.\nSPDC continues to review its portfolio options for onshore oil in Nigeria and has reduced its licences in this area by half in the past decade.\nFor more detailed information on spills in Nigeria in 2022 and our response seewww.shell.com.ng/oil-spills.

We also have short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce our\ncarbon intensity, measured using our net carbon intensity metric. We believe these targets are aligned with a 1.5°C pathway derived from the\nscenarios used in theIPCCSpecial Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, most of which show the global energy system reaching net zero\nbetween 2040 and 2060.\nBecoming a net-zero emissions energy business means that we are reducing emissions from our operations and from the fuels and other energy\nproducts, such as electricity, that we sell to our customers. It also means capturing and storing any remaining emissions using technology,\nprotecting natural carbon sinks and providing high-quality carbon credits to our customers to compensate for hard-to-abate emissions.\nWe follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, which defines three scopes of greenhouse gas\nemissions:\nScope 1: direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources under Shell’s operational control.\nScope 2: indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of purchased energy consumed by Shell assets under operational control.\nScope 3: other indirect greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions associated with the use of energy products sold by Shell.\nScope 3 emissions from the energy products we sell account formost of the total emissions we report.\nIn October 2021, in support of our 2050 net-zero emissions target, we set a target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions from assets and\nactivities under our operational control (including divestments) by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis (including carbon\ncredits).\nWe have also established remuneration policies which are designed to support us in achieving our short-term climate targets.\nRead more about our climate targets at\nwww.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/what-is-shells-net-carbon-footprint-ambition/faq.htmland in our2022 Annual Report\nand2022 Energy Transition Progress Report.\nAssessing climate-related risks\nShell has identified climate change and the associated energy transition as a material risk. The risk could potentially result in changes to the\ndemand for our products, our operational costs, supply chains, markets, the regulatory environment, our licence to operate and litigation.\nAs Shell has operations both onshore and offshore, the potential physical impacts of climate change are important for us to manage. We take\nclimate variability into consideration in the design and operation of our assets and infrastructure to minimise the risk of adverse incidents to our\nemployees and contractors, the communities where we operate, our equipment and infrastructure.\nProjects under development that are expected to have a material greenhouse gas impact must meet our internal carbon performance standards\nor industry benchmarks. Our performance standards are used for measuring a project’s average lifetime greenhouse gas intensity or energy\nefficiency per asset type. Applying these criteria ensures that our projects can compete and prosper in the energy transition. An exception\nprocess is in place to manage specific incidental cases.\nRead more about Shell’s material climate-related risks and opportunities in our2022 Annual Report.\nMore in this reportOur Powering Progress targets|Managing greenhouse gas emissions|Letter from the CEO|Performance overview\nMore on Shell websitesPowering Progress – transitioning to net-zero emissions|Our climate target|Our climate target: frequently asked questions\n22 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

Of that, we invested $4.3 billionin low-carbon energy solutions, an increase of 89% compared with the previous year. This includes\ncapital spending on biofuels, hydrogen and charging for electric vehicles, as well as wind and solar power [B]. The remaining $3.9 billionwas\ninvested in non-energy products such as chemicals, lubricants and convenience retail, which do not produce emissions when they are used by our\ncustomers. Our investment in non-energy products decreased by 9% compared with 2021.\nThese investments advance a central part of our strategy, which is to sell more products with low-carbon emissions to help both Shell and our\ncustomers meet their climate targets. See our2022 Energy Transition Progress Reportand2022 Annual Reportto learn more about our\ninvestments in energy in 2022.\n[A] Please refer to the Shell Annual Report and Accounts 2022 for the definition of cash capital expenditure.\n[B] The $4.3 billioninvestment does not include the acquisition of Nature Energy for around $2 billion, which closed at the beginning of 2023.\nNet carbon intensity\nShell’s net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and\nreported using the Net Carbon Footprint methodology. We express our net carbon intensity as the grams ofCO2equivalent permegajoule\n(gCO2e/MJ) produced for each unit of energy delivered to, and used by, a consumer.\nIn 2022, Shell’s net carbon intensity was 76 gCO2e/MJ, a 1.3% decrease from the previous year and a 3.8% reduction compared with 2016,\nthe reference year. The decrease in our net carbon intensity in 2022 was primarily due to an increased proportion of renewable power and\ncorresponding reduction in the carbon intensity of our power sales. Our 2022 net carbon intensity includes4.1 milliontonnes of emissions offset\nthrough the use of carbon credits, compared with5.1 milliontonnes that were included in our 2021 net carbon intensity. The net carbon intensity\nonly includes carbon credits that are retired against energy products.\nThe biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of, and demand for, low-carbon energy.\nWe undertake external verification of our net carbon intensity annually, and we have received third-party limited assurance on our net carbon\nintensity for the period 2016 to 2022 by LRQA. Limited assurance means nothing has come to the verifier’s attention that would indicate the net\ncarbon intensity data and information, as presented in the Net Carbon Intensity Assertion, were not materially correct.\nRead more about our Net Carbon Footprint methodology in our 2022Annual Reportand atwww.shell.com/ncf.\nNet carbon intensity [A] [B]\nGrams of CO2equivalent per megajoule (gCO2e/MJ)\n85\n80\n75\n70\n65\n60\n13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\n[A] The net carbon intensity calculation uses Shell’s energy product sales volume data, as disclosed in the Annual Report and\nSustainability Report. This excludes certain contracts held for trading purposes and is reported net rather than gross. Business-\nspecific methodologies for net volumes have been applied to oil products, pipeline gas and power. Paper trades that do not\nresult in physical product delivery are excluded. Retail sales volumes from markets where Shell operates under trademark\nlicensing agreements are also excluded from the scope of Shell’s carbon intensity metric.\n[B] Acquisitions and divestments are included in the actual performance tracking, with the target and reference year\nunchanged. Note that acquisitions and divestments could have a material impact on meeting the targets.\nAbsolute emissions reduction performance\nIn 2022, our total combined Scope 1 and 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions (from assets and activities under our operational control) were\n58 milliontonnes on a CO2equivalent basis, a 15% reduction compared with 2021, and a 30% reduction compared with 2016, the base year.\nOur Scope 3 emissions from energy products included in our net carbon intensity were1,174 milliontonnes of CO2equivalent.\n24 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

The decrease was, in part, due\nto a shutdown of the Trans Niger Pipeline, the handover of operations in OML 11 and reduced flaring atSNEPCo(all in Nigeria), as well as the\ndivestment of our Permian assets in the USA. Methane emissions were less than 2% of Shell’s greenhouse gas emissions on a CO2equivalent\nbasis in 2022. Around 65% of our reported methane emissions in 2022 came from flaring and venting in our upstream and midstream\noperations.\nOver the last few years, we have implemented more accurate methods for calculating fugitive emissions. We also encourage industry-wide\naction on methane emissions reduction by participating in voluntary initiatives.\nFor example, we co-developed the voluntaryUN-led Oil & Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and continue to\nimplement enhanced methane emissions measurement and reporting. Under OGMP 2.0, Shell achieved Gold Standard status for the 2022\nreporting year.\nWe participate in other multi-stakeholder groups, such as the Methane Guiding Principles (MGP) coalition, which we initiated in 2017, the Oil\nand Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) and the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. In 2022, members of MGP, including Shell,\ndeveloped an oil and gas sector toolkit, which connects policymakers and regulators with resources and institutions to support methane policy\nand regulation development in countries that joined the Global Methane Pledge. In 2022, OGCI launched the Aiming for Zero Methane\nEmissions by 2030 initiative, which Shell joined.\nWe continue to reduce methane emission sources across Shell-operated assets. For instance, we have reduced reported methane emissions at\nour QGC natural gas project in Australia by using multiple approaches to detect and prevent emissions, including reduced flaring and venting,\nas well as implementing more accurate methods for calculating fugitive emissions.\nWe also work with our joint ventures to help them develop emission monitoring programmes. For example, in 2022, we held sessions with several\njoint-venture partners to discuss the importance of methane emissions management and the benefits of the OGMP 2.0 reporting framework.\nRead more about Shell and methane emissions atwww.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/natural-gas/methane-emissions.\nMore in this reportOur journey to achieving net zero|Managing greenhouse gas emissions|Producing oil and natural gas\nMore on Shell websitesOur strategy: Powering Progress|Methane emissions|Reducing methane emissions in shale oil and gas|Greenhouse gas emissions|Air quality\nFlaring\nPOWERINGPROGRESS\nWe have committed to eliminate routine gas flaring from our Upstream-operated assets by 2025.\nWe are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change.

For remaining emissions, we offer and use high-quality carbon\ncredits, including from nature-based solutions.\nTo help us do that, we invest directly in natural ecosystem projects to increase the supply of carbon credits and help meet growing demand. We\nalso buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies such as fuel-efficient cookstoves.\nNature-based solutions protect and enhance natural ecosystems – such as forests, grasslands, wetlands and coastal zones – or improve\nagricultural sustainability by absorbing or preventing the release of greenhouse gases. As part of our selection criteria for nature-based solutions,\nwe look for projects that will have a net positive impact on biodiversity (seeRespecting nature).\nProjects need different levels of funding at different stages of development. In 2022, we deployed $92 million: $69 millionfor nature-based\nprojects and $23 millionfor technology-based projects that generate carbon credits.\nFor 2022, we retired around5.8 millioncarbon credits on behalf of our customers, of which4.1 millioncredits are included in our net carbon\nintensity and1.7 millioncredits are associated mainly with the sale of non-energy products and Shell’s business travel (one carbon credit\nrepresents the avoidance or removal of 1 tonne of CO2). These numbers exclude direct carbon trading activities. We carefully source and screen\nthe credits we purchase and retire from the market, and work with certification standards and rating agencies to check that our requirements are\nmet.\nIn 2022, we acquired a minority stake in Carbonext, Brazil’s largest developer of REDD+ projects (REDD+ is a framework created by the\nUNFCCC Conference of the Parties to guide activities that reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation).

We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Scotford, initially by 750,000\ntonnes per year, through our proposed Polaris project and Atlas Carbon Sequestration Hub.\nIn Australia, the GorgonCCSproject (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron), reported it had stored more than7 milliontonnes of CO2by the\nend of October 2022. Despite these significant emission reductions, Gorgon has captured and stored less CO2than required to fulfil its\nregulatory obligations. In 2022, Chevron confirmed it had purchased carbon credits to address the shortfall. In addition, the joint venture aims to\ninvest AUD40 millionin lower-carbon projects in Western Australia.

In 2022, around9.5 billionlitres of biofuels went into Shell’s petrol and diesel\nworldwide, compared with9.1 billionlitres in 2021. This included around3 billionlitres through our joint venture Raízen (Shell interest 44%, not\nShell-operated) in Brazil, compared with3.2 billionlitres in 2021.\nRaízen is one of the world’s largest biofuel producers, with one of the lowest CO2biofuels available today. In 2022, Raízen produced around\n3 billionlitres of ethanol from sugar cane and about26 millionlitres of second-generation cellulosic ethanol made from inedible agricultural\nwaste. In 2022, we signed a long-term agreement to buy3.25 billionlitres of sugar-cane cellulosic ethanol from Raízen, which will be produced\nat five new plants that Raízen intends to build.\nOne of our priorities is to increase our low-carbon fuels production capacity. In the Netherlands, we are building one of Europe’s largest biofuel\nproduction facilities, which will produce up to 820,000 tonnes per year of low-carbon fuels from predominantly waste feedstocks. The facility is\nexpected to come online in 2025.\nTo support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks. In 2022, we acquired EcoOils, which uses its recycling\ntechnology to turn waste into spent bleaching earth oil, an advanced biofuel feedstock that can be used to produce sustainable low-carbon\nfuels.\nGlobal biocomponent purchase by feedstock [A] [B]\nPercentage\n1.5%\n0.6%\n3.1% 0.5%\na Corn\n6.7%\nb Waste\n7.1% c Molasses\nghij d Palm oil\nf\ne e Rapeseed\n7.1% d 44.1% f Soy bean\na g Sugar cane\nc h Other\n8.1% b i Wheat\nj Blended feedstock\n21.3%\n[A] Does not include purchases by Raízen.\n[B] Percentage may not add up to 100% because of rounding.\nSustainability of biofuels\nWe purchase biocomponents to produce biofuels, blend into fuels and/or to trade.

Nature loss and climate change are interconnected and need to be tackled together. This was recognised in 2022 at\nthe UN Climate Change Conference (COP27), and also at the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) where a landmark Global Biodiversity\nFramework was agreed.\nAs a business, we rely on nature for resources such as land, water and materials for our operations. We recognise that our activities can have an\nimpact on nature through discharges and emissions to the environment, and through changes to the use of land, water and oceans.\nRespecting the environment and local communities has been an integral part of the way we do business for many years, as set out in the\nShell General Business PrinciplesandShell Commitment and Policy on Health, Security, Safety, the Environment and Social Performance.\nRespecting Nature is part of our Powering Progress strategy. Our commitments focus on four priority areas: biodiversity (land and marine\nenvironments), water, circular economy and waste, and air quality. They set out our ambitions for 2030 and later, as well as our shorter-term\ngoals.\nWe have included these commitments in our performance management and reporting systems and have been working to define baselines and\ntrack progress.

For example, waste that might otherwise go to landfill can be incinerated to generate energy.\nFind out more about waste and our circular economy approach atwww.shell.com/sustainability/environment/circular-economy-and-waste.\nMore in this reportSustainability at Shell|Our approach to respecting nature\nMore on Shell websitesOur strategy: Powering Progress|Circular economy and waste\nPlastics\nPOWERINGPROGRESS\nWe will work with our suppliers and contractors to help end plastic waste in the environment:\nBy 2030, we will increase the amount of recycled plastic in Shell-branded packaging to 30% and ensure that the packaging we use for\nour products is reusable or recyclable.\nWe will increase the amount of recycled materials used to make our products, starting with plastics.\nShell supports the need for improved circularity of global plastics markets and encourages reduction, reuse and recycling of plastics. We are a\nfounding member of the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which helps governments to assess and improve waste collection and waste management.\nIn 2021, we set a commitment to work with our suppliers and contractors to help end plastic waste in the environment.\nDue to market factors, such as lack of available feedstock and progress in technology development, Shell’s ability to profitably meet its1 million\ntonne plastic waste ambition by 2025 is unfeasible. Consequently, we expect to provide further insights later in 2023.\nReducing, reusing and recycling our packaging\nWe continue to explore ways to reduce, reuse and recycle packaging across our supply chains and introduce sustainable packaging.\nIn 2022, more than 30% of Shell-owned service stations had eliminated unnecessary single-use plastic including cutlery, straws and stirrers; and\nalmost 40% had completely removed single-use plastic bags. In China and North America, our bag-in-box lubricants use 89% less plastic than\n1-litre plastic bottles; and in Europe, around two-thirds of the packaging used for our Shell Car Care products (screenwash, wax, shampoo,\ncoolant and others) is recyclable.\nRecycling plastic waste as chemical feedstock\nWe are focusing on chemical recycling where we break down hard-to-recycle plastics into raw materials through a technique called pyrolysis.\nThe pyrolysis oil can then be used as feedstock in our chemical plants, replacing traditional hydrocarbon feedstock. This contributes to our\ncircular economy ambition and prevents waste that would otherwise have gone to landfill or incineration.\nIn 2022, we announced plans to build a new pyrolysis oil upgrader at the Shell Chemicals Park Moerdijk in the Netherlands. The plant, which is\nexpected to start operating in 2024, will have the capacity to produce up to 50,000 tonnes of pyrolysis oil per year.\nWe are also building a pyrolysis oil upgrader, with a production capacity of 50,000 tonnes per year, at our Shell Energy and Chemicals Park\nSingapore. Along with our joint-venture partner BlueAlp, we are building two hard-to-recycle plastic waste conversion units in the Netherlands,\nwhich are designed to convert more than 30,000 tonnes of plastic waste a year into pyrolysis oil. All three facilities are expected to start\nproduction in 2024. Shell companies also have pyrolysis oil agreements with companies in Europe, Singapore and the USA.\nFind out more about how we transform plastic waste into chemical feedstock atChemical recycling: tackling plastic waste | Shell Global.\nDiscover more about waste and our circular economy approach atwww.shell.com/sustainability/environment/circular-economy-and-waste.\nMore in this reportSustainability at Shell|Product stewardship|Driving innovation\nMore on Shell websitesOur strategy: Powering Progress|Plastic waste\n41 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

The facilities are: the PearlGTL(gas-to-\nliquids) plant in Qatar, the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore, the Shell Jurong Island chemical plant in Singapore and the Tabangao\nImport Terminal in the Philippines.\nIn 2022, these four facilities consumed18 millioncubic metres of fresh water, compared with22 millioncubic metres in 2021 and our 2018\nbaseline of25 millioncubic metres.

We are applying procedures across our businesses to improve water efficiency\nand reduce fresh-water use. This has involved detailed water circularity assessments at six Shell sites in Australia, Germany, India, Malaysia and\nthe Netherlands. The assessments taught us that water stewardship principles can be applied at our onshore facilities. We expect to update our\napproach in 2023.\n42 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

Respect for human rights is embedded in the\nShell General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human\nRights.\nWe work closely with other companies and organisations to improve how we apply these UN guiding principles. We focus on four priority areas\nwhere respect for human rights is critical to how we operate: communities, security, labour rights and supply chains.\nIn 2021 and 2022, we reviewed our salient human rights issues with the support of Business for Social Responsibility (salient human rights are\nthose that are most at risk from our operations). We assessed potential impacts on the human rights of our stakeholders according to their\npotential severity, following the widely used criteria of scale, scope and irremediability. The resulting list of our salient issues is grouped into four\nfocus areas: labour rights, supply chains, communities and security.\nFor each of these areas, we have systems to identify potential impacts and to avoid and mitigate them. For example, Shell’s HSSE & SP Control\nFramework contains requirements that set out how we identify, assess and manage our impacts on communities where we operate, including any\nimpact on human rights.\nThe Shell Supplier Principles outline how we expect our contractors and suppliers to respect the human rights of their workforce, and to manage\nthe social impacts of their activities on Shell’s neighbouring communities. When procuring solar panels and modules for our projects, for\nexample, we engage extensively with our suppliers to ensure maximum transparency of our supply chain.\nBy the end of 2022, about 460 Shell staff had completed the human rights training course launched in 2021, which is mandatory for selected\nstaff working in high-risk focus areas, such as social performance, human resources and contracting and procurement. We encourage all staff to\ndo the course, regardless of their role, to build greater understanding of human rights across Shell.\nRead more about our human rights policies and focus areas in our bookletShell's approach to human rightsand atwww.shell.com/human-rights.\nModern slavery\nShell is opposed to all forms of modern slavery. Such exploitation is against our commitment to respect human rights as set out in the UN\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\nOur approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\nRead more about our approach in our statement under the UK Modern Slavery Act atwww.shell.com/uk-modern-slavery-act.\nRead Shell Australia’s Joint Modern Slavery Statement, prepared under Australia’s Modern Slavery Act 2018, at\nwww.shell.com.au/sustainability/reporting.\n54 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

Cultural heritage refers to places of archaeological,\nhistorical, cultural, artistic and religious significance. It also includes the preservation of unique environmental features, cultural knowledge and\ntraditional lifestyles.\nOur approach starts with considering how to avoid or minimise our impact on cultural heritage. This can involve carrying out archaeological\nassessments to inform, among other things, project design and site selection. We then develop chance-find procedures to deal with previously\nunknown heritage resources that may be discovered during construction. We train staff and contractors to make them fully aware of these\nresources to give them the authority to halt work if necessary.\nIn some instances, our efforts to protect cultural heritage involve distinct social and cultural groups that share ancestral ties to the land. In Brazil,\nwe completed in 2022 a multi-year project to help 21 Quilombola communities record and reclaim their ancestral history and cultural heritage in\ntheir traditional territories.

In 2022, our crude oil and natural\ngas liquids production available for sale was 13% lower than in the previous year. This larger than usual decline was mainly driven by portfolio\nchanges, including the sale of our Permian business in the USA in late 2021 and derecognition of Sakhalin-related volumes in Russia.\nAs we transform our business, we will continue to deliver the energy the world needs today and in the decades ahead. At the same time, we are\naccelerating the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy, which is at the heart of our strategy.\nRead more about our approach at\nwww.shell.com/sustainability/integrating-sustainability-into-our-activities/producing-oil-and-gas-responsibly-and-efficiently.\nLiquefied natural gas\nAs one of the world’s largest suppliers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), we can ship natural gas to where it is needed. For instance, in 2022 we\ndelivered a record 194 cargoes of LNG to Europe – almost five times our usual average – to help replace Russian gas and maintain supply for\npeople and businesses. LNG also plays an important role in enabling countries to replace coal-fired power generation with a less carbon-\nintensive alternative.\nIn 2022, our Colibri project (Shell interest 87%) in Trinidad and Tobago started production. Colibri delivers natural gas domestically and\ninternationally through Atlantic LNG, one of the world’s largest LNG plants (Shell’s interest ranges from 46% to 57.5% in each of the four trains\nat the facility). We are also part of the North Field East and North Field South expansion projects in Qatar, the largest LNG project ever, which\nwill supply markets worldwide and include carbon capture and storage to reduce emissions. And, we made final investment decisions to develop\noffshore gas projects in the UK North Sea and, with our partners, in Australia and Malaysia. First gas is expected from these projects in the\nmid-2020s.\nRead more about natural gas atwww.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/natural-gas.\nShale oil and gas\nFollowing the divestment of our Permian business in the USA in 2021, we have limited involvement in shale oil and gas production.\nWe work to unlock our remaining shale resources safely and responsibly through strict adherence to our Onshore Operating Principles for safety,\nair, water, footprint and community. We conduct our operations in a manner that aims to protect air quality and reduce emissions. For example,\nwe are implementing greenhouse gas abatement projects for our facilities, such as using renewable power supply and energy efficiency\nimprovement initiatives.\nRead more about shale oil and gas production atwww.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/shale-oil-and-gas.\nArctic\nWe do not plan to pursue new oil exploration leases offshore in the Arctic Circle.\nShell ended offshore exploration drilling operations in Alaska in 2015. We hold one licence interest in the North Slope area of Alaska. In 2020,\nwe received regulatory approval to combine our near-shore leases in West Harrison Bay into a single unit and we are currently seeking a co-\nowner to operate the unit. The Nikaitchuq North prospect, in which Shell held a 50% interest, was relinquished by both Shell and ENI in 2022.\nIn Norway, Shell is a 10% partner in Irpa, an offshore natural gas discovery located in an area of existing gas production within the Arctic Circle.\nIrpa is planned as a tie-in to the existing Aasta Hansteen platform (operated by Equinor), which already supplies natural gas to the Nyhamna\nprocessing plant, where Shell is responsible for providing significant exports of gas to Europe.\nWe also hold several licences from our previous activities in the Canadian Arctic, although we do not plan to develop these licences. Shell exited\nits 50% interest in the Gydan energy venture in Russia in 2022. At the time of exit, Gydan had no production and had yet to make a commercial\ndiscovery.\nRead more about our approach at\nwww.shell.com/sustainability/integrating-sustainability-into-our-activities/producing-oil-and-gas-responsibly-and-efficiently.\nMore in this reportOur Powering Progress targets|Letter from the CEO\nMore on Shell websitesPowering Progress – transitioning to net-zero emissions|Integrating sustainability into our activities\n60 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

The mandatory requirements in our Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social Performance (HSSE & SP) Control\nFramework help to ensure projects and facilities are designed and constructed safely, responsibly and in a consistent way.\nAt a project level, assessing climate-related risks is an important part of making initial investment decisions. Projects under development that are\nexpected to have a material greenhouse gas impact must meet our internal carbon performance standards or industry benchmarks. This helps to\nensure that our projects can compete and prosper in the energy transition.\nIn 2022, we took a final investment decision to start building Europe’s largest renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands. Once operational\nin 2025, the plant will produce up to 80 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per day using clean energy from an offshore wind farm partly owned by\nShell. The hydrogen will supply the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam.\nAlso in 2022, we took a final investment decision to develop the Rosmari-Marjoram gas project (Shell interest 80%), which lies off Malaysia’s\ncoast. The offshore production platform will be powered mainly by solar panels and the onshore gas plant primarily by hydroelectricity from the\nmainland power grid.\nRead more about how we embed sustainability into the life of a project atwww.shell.com/sustainability/embedding-sustainability-into-projects.\nRead about our major projects atwww.shell.com/about-us/major-projects.\nDecommissioning and restoration\nDecommissioning is part of the normal life cycle of every oil and gas structure. We work hard to close and dispose of installations in a safe,\nefficient, cost-effective and environmentally responsible manner. This includes restoring the surroundings of platforms and facilities in line with\nrelevant legislation, while taking our own environmental standards into account.\nWe have decommissioning and restoration activities under way in Brazil, Brunei, India, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA. We seek to reuse,\nrepurpose and recycle materials in decommissioning. At the end of 2022, we reported $20 billionon our balance sheet for current and non-\ncurrent decommissioning and other provisions, which is how we account for future decommissioning expenses (see our 2022Annual Report).\nShell invests in innovative decommissioning and restoration technologies, both in-house and by funding third parties. For instance, our Local\nExpander technology is used throughout the industry to plug unused wells and stop methane and liquids from escaping over time.

We support\ntransparency and share information and data in this report and on www.shell.com.\nThere are inherent limitations to the accuracy of environmental, safety and social performance data. We recognise that our data will be affected\nby these limitations, so we continue to improve data integrity by strengthening our internal controls.\nWe provide all non-financial data in this report on a 100% basis for companies and joint ventures where we are the operator unless otherwise\nstated, in line with industry practice. We believe that the operational control boundary best reflects existing regulatory requirements, as well as\ninternal policies, for the management of potential health, safety, environmental and social impacts.\nOur Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using two boundaries: operational control and equity. Under the operational\ncontrol boundary, we report 100% of greenhouse gas emissions from the assets that we operate, regardless of how much equity we have in\nthose assets. Under the equity boundary, we report the greenhouse gas emissions that correspond to our proportion of equity in both operated\nand non-operated assets. Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions under the equity boundary for 2022 are expected to be published later in\nthe year as an update to this report and on our corporate website.\nOperations that we acquired or divested during 2022 are included only for the period in which we operated those assets.\nWe refer to the number of people employed on a full- and part-time basis. This includes people working in Shell subsidiaries, Shell-operated joint\nventures and those seconded to non-Shell-operated joint operations, or ventures and associates. Employee metrics exclude the employees in\nportfolio companies, except for the metrics reflecting total employee numbers, actual number of employees by geography, percentage of women\nemployees, and mandatory training courses.\nOther data are collected from external sources, employee surveys and other internal sources as indicated. Some data in the social performance\ndata table come from an internal survey completed by the senior Shell representative in each country. The accuracy of environmental and social\ndata may be lower than that of data obtained through our financial systems.\nWe only include data in this report for 2022 that were confirmed by the end of February 2023. If incidents are reclassified or confirmed, or if\nsignificant data changes occur after preparation of this report, they will be updated in the following year’s publication.\nAssurance\nWe have clear standards and reporting requirements for our health, safety, security, environment and social performance (HSSE & SP) data.\nShell companies are required to adopt these standards, which define management roles and responsibilities, the scope of data at facilities and\nhow data are calculated and collected. These standards are part of our HSSE & SP Control Framework.\nTo ensure we provide accurate information, our assurance process for HSSE & SP data is also a key element of the HSSE & SP Control\nFramework. Some examples of the assurance mechanisms in this process are:\nself-assessments at the facility level;\ninternal audits at all levels of Shell;\nquarterly reviews and assessments of the data at all levels;\nan annual series of meetings between leaders at Group level and senior business managers to discuss outcomes and reporting parameters; and\nformal sign-off by Shell’s senior country leaders.\nSome acquired companies in new business sectors are not yet in full compliance with the Shell Control Framework. Following specific\nassessments for each of these companies, dedicated projects were put in place to achieve compliance, with regular updates on progress.\nThe Carbon Reporting Committee, which was formed in 2021, is tasked with ensuring that greenhouse gas emission measures – absolute\nemissions and carbon intensity, and associated metrics – comply with all regulatory and legal requirements.\nThe Report Review Panel of independent experts helps ensure our reporting is balanced, relevant and responsive to stakeholder interests.\nLRQA has provided limited assurance of our net carbon intensity (measured and reported using the Net Carbon Footprint methodology), Scope\n1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions data under operational control for 2022, and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from energy products\nincluded in our net carbon intensity. Limited assurance means nothing has come to the verifier’s attention that would indicate the greenhouse gas\ndata and information, as presented in the Net Carbon Intensity Assertion and the Greenhouse Gas Statement/Assertion, were not materially\ncorrect. The most recent assurance statements are available atwww.shell.com/ghg.\nConversions into US and Canadian dollars are based on the average exchange rates for 2022.\nMore in this reportOur Powering Progress targets|Our standards and policies|Letter from the CEO\nMore on Shell websitesPowering Progress – transitioning to net-zero emissions\n64 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

It is designed to integrate sustainability with our business strategy, in support of our purpose – to power progress\ntogether by providing more and cleaner energy solutions.\nSocio-economic, political and market factors sometimes affect our portfolio choices. While no decisions have been made, existing global\nbusiness targets are currently under review, as part of normal strategy evolution. We expect to provide further insights during our Capital\nMarkets Day in June 2023. Read more in thecautionary note.\nSelected targets and commitments under Powering Progress include:\nAchieving net-zero emissions\nWorking with our customers and across sectors to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions.\nShell’s climate target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.\nOur targets include reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to 2016 levels, on a net basis, and reducing\nthe carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 6-8% by 2023, 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035 and\n100% by 2050.\nIn 2022, we linked the pay of more than 16,500 staff to our target to reduce the carbon intensity of our energy products by 9-12% by 2024,\ncompared with 2016.\nWe have committed to eliminate routine gas flaring from our Upstream-operated assets by 2025.\nWe have set a target to keep our methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets (including liquefied natural gas) below 0.2% by\n2025.\nRespecting nature\nProtecting the environment, reducing waste and making a positive contribution to biodiversity.\nBiodiversity\nOur ambition is to have a positive impact on biodiversity.\nOur new projects in areas rich in biodiversity – critical habitats – will have a net positive impact on biodiversity, starting implementation in\n2021.\nOur nature-based solution projects, which protect, transform or restore land, will have anet positive impacton biodiversity, starting\nimplementation in 2021.\nWe will replant forests, achieving net-zero deforestation fromnewactivities, while maintaining biodiversity and conservation value, starting\nimplementation in 2022.\nWater\nOur ambition is to conserve fresh water by reducing consumption and increasing reuse and recycling.\nWe will reduce the amount of fresh water consumed in our facilities, starting by reducing fresh-water consumption by 15% by 2025, compared\nwith 2018 levels, in areas where there is high pressure on fresh-water resources.\nCircular economy and waste\nOur ambition is to use resources and materials efficiently and to increase reuse andrecycling.\nWe are aiming for zero waste by reducing waste generated and increasing reuse and recycling in our businesses and supply chains. We\naimed to set goals for waste reduction, reuse and recycling by the end of 2022.\nWe will work with our suppliers and contractors to help end plastic waste in the environment:\nBy 2030, we will increase the amount of recycled plastic in Shell-branded packaging to 30% and ensure that the packaging we use for\nour products is reusable or recyclable.\nWe will increase the amount of recycled materials used to make our products, starting with plastics.\nAir quality\nWe are helping to improve air quality by reducing emissions from our operations and providing cleaner ways to power transport and industry.\nCollaboration and reporting\nWe are strengthening external partnerships and improving transparency on performance.\nSupply chain: We will include requirements in our purchasing policies to reflect our environmental framework, and take the energy efficiency,\nmaterial efficiency and sustainability of products into consideration in our purchases.\nExternal partnerships: We will ensure external partnerships inform key areas of development and delivery of our ambitions.\nExternal reporting: We will transparently report performance in our annual Sustainability Report.\n66 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

The data are\ncalculated using locally regulated methods where they exist. Where there is no locally regulated method, the data are calculated using the 2009 API Compendium, which is the\nrecognised industry standard under the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. There are inherent limitations to the accuracy of such data. Oil and gas industry\nguidelines (Ipieca/API/IOGP) indicate that several sources of uncertainty can contribute to the overall uncertainty of a corporate emissions inventory. We have estimated the overall\nuncertainty for our direct GHG emissions to be around 3% for 2022.\n[B] GHG emissions were calculated using global warming potential (GWP) factors from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report. For comparison, our Scope1 emissions would have been 51\nmillion tonnes in 2022 if we were to use GWPs from IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report.\n[C] GHG emissions in this table do not include carbon credits.\n[D] Split by business or country may not add up to the total due to rounding.\n[E] Includes Scotford Upgrader and Quest Carbon Capture and Storage. Excludes CO2captured and sequestered by Quest, but Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from operating Quest are\nincluded.\n[F] Includes emissions from other Downstream assets and activities (e.g. shipping, lubricants and trading & supply).\n[G] Includes emissions from assets and activities reported by the Projects & Technology business and Global Functions.\n[H] Methane emissions were converted to CO2equivalents using GWPs from the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report. For comparison, our methane emissions would have been 1.1 million tonnes\nin CO2equivalents in 2022 if we were to use GWPs from IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report.\n[I] Includes Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.\n[J] Calculated as total hydrocarbons flared divided by sum of total oil and gas wellhead production, LNG and GTL production x 100%.\n[K] GHG emissions related to energy production (in the form of electricity, heat or steam) that was exported to another facility or public grid. This is a subset of our Scope1 GHG emissions.\n73 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

In this report \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and\n\"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\",\n\"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where\nno useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this\nreport refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has\njoint control are generally referred to as \"joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\", respectively. \"Joint ventures\" and \"joint operations\" are collectively\nreferred to as \"joint arrangements\". Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as\n\"associates\". The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or\nunincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.\nForward-looking statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the\nfinancial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to\nbe, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current\nexpectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to\ndiffer materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements\nconcerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts,\nprojections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\",\n\"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\",\n\"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future\noperations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this\nreport, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency\nfluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and\nphysical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and\ncompletion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j)\nlegislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial\nmarket conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of\ncontracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m)\nrisks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No\nassurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained\nin this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not\nplace undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022 (available atwww.shell.com/investorand www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all\nforward-looking statements contained in this report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of\nthe date of this report, March 28, 2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any\nforward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially\nfrom those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nShell’s Net Carbon Intensity\nAlso, in this report we may refer to Shell’s \"Net Carbon Intensity\", which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy\nproducts, our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use\nof the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s \"Net Carbon Intensity\" is for convenience only\nand not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.\nShell’s net-zero emissions target\nShell’s operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic\nenvironment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 andNCItargets\nover the next ten years. However, Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target, as these\ntargets are currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell’s operating plans to\nreflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.\nOther business targets\nPortfolio allocation affects our ability to deliver on targets we have made, and socio-economic, political and market factors sometimes change\nour outlooks. Existing global targets are currently under review. While no decisions have been made, to ensure our transition to a net-zero energy\nbusiness is profitable, it is likely some business KPI targets may be retired, as part of normal strategy evolution and mindful of existing capital\nallocation in the latest Operating Plan. We expect to provide further insights during our Capital Markets Day in June 2023. All targets presented\nat Capital Markets Day in June will be filed with theSEC.\nForward-looking non-GAAP measures\nThis report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAPmeasures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to\nprovide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain\n87 ShellSustainability Report 2022"

Moreover, estimating such GAAP\nmeasures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished\nwithout unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP\nfinancial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report.\nWe may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly\nprohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575,\navailable on the SEC website www.sec.gov.\nAdditional information\nAs used in this Report, \"Accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The Accountable person does not\nnecessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the\nimplementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that\nthe framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell\ncompany and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles,\nCode of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the\noperationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies.\nCO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions\nremain in the atmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower-emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil\nfuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions.\n\"Carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the\nremaining CO2e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage/end-of-life (if Lubricants or\nother non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2\ncompensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the\ncompensation may not be exact.\nCO2e (CO2equivalent) refers to CO2, CH4, N2O.\n88 ShellSustainability Report 2022"
