By year’s end, we had achieved more than 60% of our target of halving carbon emissions in our own operations by\n2030, compared with 2016. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3%\nreduction against our target of 6–8% compared with 2016.\nWe work hard to minimise risk throughout our operations. I am deeply saddened that four of our contractor colleagues in Shell-operated\nventures died in 2023: one in Malaysia, one in the Philippines and two in an attack on a convoy in Nigeria. Four government security agents\nalso lost their lives in the attack. A fifth contractor colleague, who was injured in a fire in Nigeria in 2023, passed away in February 2024. We\nare determined to learn from these incidents and take steps to prevent something similar from happening again.\nDelivering oil and gas with less emissions\nAs we continue to deliver the oil and gas that the global energy system relies on, we are reducing the carbon emitted in its production.\nWe expect liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition. LNG produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal\nwhen used to generate electricity and fewer emissions than petrol or diesel when used as transport fuel. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids\nas wind and solar power grow.\nIn 2023, we helped two additional countries reduce their reliance on coal-fired power generation by delivering the first cargoes of LNG to new\nimport terminals in the Philippines and Vietnam.\nWe are also working to reduce the emissions intensity of our LNG projects.LNGCanada (Shell interest 40%, non-operated), which is expected\nto start production later this decade, is designed to have the lowest carbon intensity of any large liquefaction facility currently operating\nanywhere in the world ― about 60% lower than the average facility today and 35% lower than the best-performing facility.\nReducing emissions of methane is one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the goal of the Paris Agreement within reach. We aim to\nkeep methane emissions below 0.2% at Shell-operated oil and gas assets each year, and I am pleased to say we achieved this again in 2023.\nOur target is to achieve near-zero methane emissions by the end of this decade.\nDespite the progress we have made, there is much work still to be done and lessons to be learned, whether from safety incidents or in how to\ndevelop new projects that minimise our impact on the environment.\nOur latest offshore oil and gas facility in the US Gulf of Mexico, Vito (Shell interest 63.1%), is a compelling example of how we work to embed\nsustainability and emissions reduction into the life cycle of our projects, from design to decommissioning. Vito, which started production in 2023,\nis one-third of the size of its original design. It is expected to reduceCO2emissions by about 80% over its operating life. We are now repeating\nthe same concept in other new offshore projects.\nInvesting in the energy transition\nWe are also investing in low-carbon and non-energy products that reduce emissions for our customers.\nIn 2023, we invested$5.6 billionin low-carbon energy solutions, including biofuels, hydrogen, charging for electric vehicles and renewable\npower generation; and$2.3 billionon non-energy products such as chemicals, lubricants and convenience retail, which do not produce\nemissions when our customers use them. This amounted to around one-third of our total capital spending in 2023.\n02 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

These include testing a new solid sorbent\ntechnology to remove CO2emissions from the air, and an electrolyser to produce hydrogen from renewable energy at higher efficiency and\nlower cost than is currently possible.\nRespecting nature\nAlong with generating shareholder value and achieving net-zero emissions, our Powering Progress strategy is about powering lives and\nrespecting nature.\nWe have already achieved some of the commitments made under our respecting nature goal, which we set in 2021. These include reducing fresh-\nwater consumption by 15% compared with 2018 in areas where water supplies are stressed, which we reached ahead of the target date of\n2025.\nWe are working hard to help develop a viable circular economy for plastics, despite a global lack of feedstock made from plastic waste, slow\ntechnology development and regulatory uncertainty. In 2023, we signed several strategic co-operation agreements with partners to increase\nsupplies of feedstock and enable its long-term storage.\nWe also continued to remove single-use plastics like cups and cutlery from our Shell-owned service stations and to find new ways to reduce,\nrecycle or reuse plastics in our packaging for lubricants and car-care products.\nPowering lives\nEnergy is essential to human life. Yet too many people in the world have no or, at best, unreliable access to electricity. Even more lack clean\ncooking facilities. For many years, we have worked to bring reliable and affordable electricity and improved cooking conditions to those who do\nnot have them. We invest in businesses that supply energy access in emerging markets and we provide funds and expertise to social investment\nprogrammes.\nShell has pledged$200 millionas part of a broader initiative to help people in sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-east Asia get access to\nenergy in the near and medium term.\nWe are making progress in our ambition to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. For instance, in 2023, 32%\nof our senior leadership positions were held by women, which is close to our target of 35% by 2025. As of January 1, 2024, for the first time in\nour history we have more women than men on our Executive Committee.\nWe continue to support theUNGlobal Compact’s corporate governance principles on human rights, environmental protection, anti-corruption\nand better labour practices. We respect human rights in our business and work hard to ensure that our joint-venture partners and supply chains\ndo the same.\nWe recognise the importance of a just transition to a net-zero emissions energy system in which the costs and benefits are distributed fairly. In the\nUK, for example, we are supporting three Energy Transition Skills Hubs that plan to help 15,000 people into jobs with a focus on the energy\ntransition by 2035.\nThis is our 27th Shell Sustainability Report, a voluntary publication we have issued each year since 1997. As of 2024, our sustainability\nreporting will be integrated with the Shell Annual Report and Accounts. I welcome this step, which brings all our reporting into one document.\nWe will continue to be transparent in our reporting and demonstrate that sustainability is embedded in our way of doing business.\nWael Sawan\nChief Executive Officer\nMore in this reportSustainability at Shell|Our journey to net zero|Our approach to respecting nature|Providing access to energy\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Shell at a glance\n03 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

SUSCO assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibilities by reviewing the progress of\nShell with respect to sustainability and the non-financial elements of Shell’s Powering Progress strategy.\nThe Committee meets regularly to review and discuss a wide range of topics, including progress on Shell’s Powering Progress goals of net-zero\nemissions, respecting nature, and powering lives. The Committee also reviews wider matters of public concern such as biodiversity, plastic waste\nand methane emissions.\nIn 2023, the Committee visited Shell’s Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland in Germany to review energy transition projects and safety and to\nmeet staff and a senior government representative. Two Committee members also visited the Olympus offshore platform in the US Gulf of Mexico\nto review safety and sustainability performance.\nThe Board of Directors has primary oversight of the delivery of Shell’s energy transition strategy and is supported by SUSCO, the Audit and Risk\nCommittee(ARC) and the Remuneration Committee (REMCO).\nRead more about SUSCO and how Shell manages sustainability atwww.shell.com/sustainability/our-approach/governanceand in our2023\nAnnual Report and Accounts(Annual Report).\nMore in this reportOur journey to net zero|Our approach to safety|Energy transition|Our approach to respecting nature\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Board of Directors|Sustainability governance\n05 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

It details our social, safety and environmental\nperformance in 2023. As of 2024, our sustainability reporting will be integrated with the Shell Annual Report and Accounts.\nEach year we use a structured process to select the report’s content. We engage with various groups and individuals to understand specific\nconcerns about our business and its impact, particularly relating to the environment and society. We consider the views of others such as non-\ngovernmental organisations, customers, the media, academics, investors and employees.\nInput from our Report Review Panel of independent experts helps to ensure that coverage is relevant, balanced, fair and complete.\nRead more about our topic selection process atwww.shell.com/sustainability/transparency-and-sustainability-reporting/sustainability-reports.\nReporting guidelines\nOur reporting is informed by several voluntary reporting standards and guidelines including those developed by Ipieca, the global oil and gas\nindustry association for advancing environmental and social performance across the energy transition, and the Global Reporting Initiative(GRI)\n(see theGRI content indexandwww.shell.com/voluntary-reporting-standards-and-esg-ratingsfor full details).\nAs a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, we support the organisation’s updated criteria for membership, which\ninclude requirements for corporate transparency.\nWe are also a founding member and a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact.

In 2021, Shell altered its\napproach to sustainability reporting in order to highlight significant data with further explanations and background provided through links\nto Shell.com. It should be noted that the panel has no remit in connection with the website and has not reviewed any of the information\nprovided therein.\nOverall, the panel has welcomed the conciseness of the Sustainability Report and has been keen to ensure that sufficient explanation of\nthe context of the data is included in order to help readers better understand the information without having to resort immediately to\nclicking on website links. The panel has therefore stressed the importance of including transparent, qualitative information along with the\nfigures, and we are pleased that this has been recognised by Shell who has continued to make progress in this area although more\nremains to be done. The use of graphics to get across progress on strategic priorities is a useful tool in this respect and we welcome that\nShell continues to adopt this approach.\nHighlighting key differences between the current report and that of the previous year is also useful such as changes to the most important\ntopics, reasons for achieving or not achieving key targets or significant external actions such as the signing of the Oil and Gas\nDecarbonization Charter launched atCOP28. However, there is also an opportunity to better demonstrate the connections between the\ndifferent topics. For example, making further links between the human rights section and other sustainability topics could aid readers to\nunderstand Shell’s overall approach and to highlight that this approach is also guided by respecting people.\nWe were also pleased to see additional detail on the actions taken in relation to contributing to a just transition. The respecting nature\nsection has also been more elaborated than previously, although more transparency about the challenges involved would be useful. We\nwere also pleased to see additional detail on salient human rights issues and Shell’s broader approach to managing human rights risks.\nTo further improve transparency, the panel recommends that Shell provides additional information and data on the following:\nEnsuring that key terms and concepts used throughout the report are clearly defined.\nThe human rights risks associated with the transition to renewable solutions (including solar) and in connection with biodiversity, and\nactions taken to manage these risks.\nHow Shell has used its salient human rights issues assessment to prioritise its human rights risk management actions, including more\ndetail on how these issues guide work under its four focus areas.\nHow Shell tracks the effectiveness of its sustainability performance, including comparisons with other sectors.\nClearer information on the key challenges faced by Shell in achieving its respecting nature targets.\nThe environmental challenges associated with wind and solar activities.\nMore detail on the nature of stakeholder engagements.\"\nMore in this reportSustainability at Shell|About our data|Our standards and policies|GRI content index\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Voluntary reporting standards and ESG ratings|External voluntary codes\n09 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

We aim to do no harm to people and to have no leaks across our\noperations. We call this our Goal Zero ambition.\nWe seek to improve safety by focusing on the three areas where the safety risks associated with our activities are highest: personal, process and\ntransport. We strive to reduce risks and to minimise the potential impact of any incident, with a particular emphasis on the risks with the most\nserious consequences if something goes wrong.\nOur multi-year process of refreshing our approach to safety for all employees and contractors started in 2020. This approach is rooted in a\nconsistent focus on human performance. We ask people at Shell to apply a learner mindset, by which we mean the belief that we can always\nimprove, enhance individual capabilities, learn from mistakes and successes, and speak up freely without repercussions.\nIn practice, our refreshed approach to safety is about enhancing how we prepare for and conduct high-risk activities by, for example:\nexecuting frontline work: build an environment of trust and learning, strengthen team leaders’ coaching and engagement skills, and embed\npre-start work preparations such as those developed by the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP);\napplying acknowledged industry safety tools: in 2022, we moved from the Shell Life-Saving Rules to industry-wide Life-Saving Rules so that\nShell staff and contractors are working on the same basis to manage risks; and\nusing technology and digital tools to reduce exposure, identify conditions that may lead to serious incidents and fatalities, and enhance\nlearning.\nIt is also about capturing more insights by, for example:\nusing metrics focused on serious injuries and fatalities (SIF) and the lessons that we can derive from high-potential incidents and events that\ncould have led to SIF incidents;\nseeking to capture underlying causes and systemic patterns through incident investigations; and\naiming to embed lessons learned from the above points in training and instructions for work preparation and execution.\nIn 2023, we integrated this safety approach into the plans of our facilities, projects and functions. Many of our non-operated ventures and\ncompanies that are operated by Shell, but not integrated into our systems, have also chosen to implement elements of our refreshed approach.\nRead more about our approach to safety atwww.shell.com/safety.\nMore in this reportPreparing for emergencies|Letter from the CEO|Respecting human rights\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Safety|HSSE materials for contractors\nPersonal safety\nWe continue to strengthen the safety culture and leadership among our employees and contractor staff. This aligns with our focus on caring for\npeople.\nWhen our employees and contractors perform tasks, we expect them to consider the hazards that could potentially cause serious harm and the\neffectiveness of the barriers in place to avoid serious harm.\nWe run safety awareness programmes and hold an annual global Safety Day to give employees and contractors time to discuss safety culture\non the frontline, reflect on how to prevent incidents and how to improve performance. In 2023, the focus was on ”failing safely”, which means\nwe recognise that people make mistakes and that our barriers need to be capable of managing the impact of those mistakes to prevent harm.\nIn 2023, we achieved safe construction, commissioning and start-up of a floating production unit (FPU) for the Shell-operated Vito field (Shell\ninterest 63.1%) in the US Gulf of Mexico. The fabrication of another FPU, Whale (Shell interest 60%) in the Gulf of Mexico, was completed in\n2023 after12 millionhours without fatality or serious injury.\nWorking with others\nWe work with contractors and suppliers to help them understand our safety requirements. We strive to help improve the energy industry’s safety\nperformance by sharing safety standards and experience with other operators, joint-venture partners, contractors and professional\norganisations.\n14 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

SPDC\nhas introduced anti-theft protection mechanisms for key infrastructure, including steel cages to protect wellheads.\nIn 2023, 60 new steel cages were installed around critical infrastructure nodes, bringing the total number of cages installed to 374. This includes\n52 cages that have been upgraded with CCTV and 28 with satellite communications. In 2023, out of 508 registered attempts to breach the\ncages, 38 were successful.\nSPDC has an ongoing programme to appraise, maintain and replace key sections of pipelines and flow lines in order to reduce the number of\noperational spills. In 2023, around 54 kilometres of pipelines and flow lines were replaced.\nResponse and remediation\nRegardless of the cause of a spill, SPDC cleans up and remediates areas affected by spills originating from its facilities. In 2023, the time that\nSPDC needed to complete the recovery of free-phase oil — oil that forms a separate layer and is not mixed with water or soil — remained at\naround one week.\nIn January 2024, Shell announced the sale of SPDC.

We seek to reduce these risks by\ndeveloping best-practice standards within Shell. We also work with specialist contractors, industry bodies, non-governmental organisations and\ngovernments to find ways of reducing transport safety risks.\nRoad safety\nIn 2023, Shell employees and contractors drove around464 millionkilometres on work-related business. Commercial road transport accounts\nfor most of the kilometres, but only two of this year’s 18 severe motor vehicle incidents (SMVIs) happened during commercial road transport.\nNine SMVIs occurred during business travel, two during commercial transport activities and the remaining seven during on-site operations. There\nwere no road transport-related fatalities in 2023.\nIn 2023, about 30,600 Shell employees and contractors were identified as driving on work-related business, and therefore required defensive\ndriver training (DDT). In 2023, we launched an internal virtual DDT course to align better with industry partners’ approaches.\nBy the end of 2023, we had installed active fatigue and distraction detection (AFDD) devices in around 3,380 vehicles operated by Shell or our\ncontractors in countries where road transport risks are highest. In 2024, we will continue to install AFDD devices in vehicles operated by Shell,\nincluding both contractor and Shell-owned vehicles. The AFDD devices have recorded and intervened in at least 130 high-risk fatigue events,\npreventing what could have resulted in motor vehicle incidents if the devices had not alerted the drivers.\nSafety at sea\nAt the end of 2023, we managed and operated a global fleet of 25 tankers, liquefied natural gas carriers and the world’s first liquefied\nhydrogen carrier, the Suiso Frontier. We are one of the world’s largest charterers of oil and gas vessels. We work with our 500 global maritime\npartners through our Maritime Partners in Safety Programme to improve the safety performance of the shipping industry.\nIn 2023, we held 20 workshops on applying cause and effect analysis in incident investigations.

Measured separately for assets with marketed gas (gas, LNG andGTLavailable for sale) and assets without marketed\ngas (oil and gas assets where gas is reinjected). 2023 actual performance relates to assets with marketed gas.\n[E] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in\n2021.\nShell recognises that greenhouse gas emissions from our operations as well as the use of hydrocarbon-based energy contribute to climate\nchange.The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by \"holding the increase in the global\naverage temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above\npreindustrial levels\". Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this\ncentury to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.\nOur target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. To help us get there, we have set short-, medium- and long-term targets\nto reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, measured using our net carbon intensity metric. We believe these targets are\naligned with a 1.5°C pathway derived from scenarios developed for the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment (AR6) Report.\nBecoming a net-zero emissions energy business means reducing emissions from our operations and from the fuels and other energy products,\nsuch as electricity, that we sell to our customers. It also means capturing and storing any remaining emissions using technology, protecting\nnatural carbon sinks and providing high-quality carbon credits to our customers to compensate for hard-to-abate emissions.\nWe follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, which defines three scopes of greenhouse gas\nemissions:\nScope 1: direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources under Shell’s operational control;\nScope 2: indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of purchased energy consumed by Shell assets under operational control; and\nScope3: other indirect greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions associated with the use of energy products sold by Shell.\nScope3 emissions from the energy products we sell account for most of the total emissions we report.\nIn October 2021, in support of our 2050 net-zero emissions target, we set a target to reduce Scope1 and 2 absolute emissions from assets and\nactivities under our operational control (including divestments) by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. By the end of 2023,\nwe had achieved more than 60% of our target (seeDelivering our climate targets).\nWe have also established remuneration policies which are designed to support our short-term climate targets (seeRemuneration).\nIn March 2024, we published ourEnergy Transition Strategy 2024, in which we take stock of our progress since launching our Powering\nProgress strategy in 2021 and look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050.\nWe are also working with governments on their climate policies to help establish regulatory frameworks that will enable society to reach the\ngoals of the Paris Agreement. In March 2024, we updated ourglobal climate and energy transition policy positions. By advocating these\npositions as we transform our business, we believe we are supporting both the energy transition and the Paris Agreement.\n22 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

We also intend to contribute to the World Bank’s Global\nFlaring and Methane Reduction Fund, which was launched at COP28.\nRead more about our climate targets atwww.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/what-is-shells-net-carbon-footprint-ambition/\nfaq.htmland in our2023 Annual ReportandEnergy Transition Strategy 2024.\nSupporting our customers\nEmissions resulting from customer use of our energy products make up the largest percentage of Shell’s carbon emissions. We believe we can\nmake the greatest contribution to the energy transition by helping to enable our customers to switch to low-carbon energy products and services.\nThis is reflected in our strategy to develop a portfolio that seeks to:\ndevelop low- and zero-carbon alternatives to traditional fuels, including biofuels, hydrogen and other low- and zero-carbon gases;\nprovide more electricity to customers, while also driving a shift to renewable electricity;\nwork with customers across different sectors to help them decarbonise their use of energy, for example by substituting the use of coal with\nliquefied natural gas; and\naddress any remaining emissions from conventional fuels with solutions such as carbon capture and storage and carbon credits.\nAssessing climate-related risks and opportunities\nShell has identified climate change and the associated energy transition as a material risk based on societal concerns and developments related\nto climate change and managing greenhouse gas emissions. The risks could potentially result in changes to the demand for our products, supply\nchains and markets, and in further changes to the regulatory environment in which we operate.\nOverall, we mitigate climate-related risks through our Powering Progress strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. With our focus on\nperformance, discipline and simplification, we believe that we are in a better position to achieve both our financial and climate-related targets\nand ambitions. This approach includes:\nreducing the greenhouse gas emissions from our operations (Scope1 and 2) by improving our energy efficiency, deploying renewable\nelectricity, managing flaring and reducing methane emissions from our assets and projects;\ngrowing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business while decarbonising our LNG portfolio in two main ways: by growing our\nportfolio with a lower carbon intensity, and by focusing on reducing methane emissions;\nmanaging our Upstream portfolio by cutting emissions from oil and gas production, while keeping oil production stable. Oil production is\nincreasingly from our deep-water business which, through innovation, produces higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels; and\ntransforming our businesses in Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions to offer low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil\nproducts.\nIn addition, we are working to effectively adapt our assets and activities to enhance our resilience to the physical risks related to climate change\nwhere needed.\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy also brings significant opportunities. As the global energy mix changes, our current infrastructure, know-\nhow and global footprint put us in an ideal position to service the changing energy demands of the market. As we work to deliver more value\nwith less emissions, we are focusing on natural gas, particularlyLNG; continuing the transformation of select integrated refineries into energy\nand chemicals parks; biofuels; and developing low-carbon products and solutions for our customers.\nRead more about Shell’s material climate-related risks and opportunities in our2023 Annual Report.\nMore in this reportOur Powering Progress targets|Managing greenhouse gas emissions|Letter from the CEO|Performance overview\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Our climate target|Our climate target: frequently asked questions\n23 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

The data are calculated using locally regulated methods where they exist. Where\nthere is no locally regulated method, the data are calculated using the 2021 API Compendium, which is the recognised\nindustry standard under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. There are inherent\nlimitations on the accuracy of such data. Oil and gas industry guidelines (Ipieca, API and IOGP) indicate that several sources\nof uncertainty can contribute to the overall uncertainty of a corporate emissions inventory. We have estimated the overall\nuncertainty for our direct greenhouse gas emissions to be around 4% for 2023.\n[B] Greenhouse gas emissions for 2023 were calculated using global warming potential (GWP) factors from the IPCC Fifth\nAssessment Report. Data from previous years were calculated using GWP factors from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. For\ncomparison, our Scope 1 emissions would still have been50 milliontonnes in 2023 if we were to use GWPs from the IPCC\nFourth Assessment Report.\n[C] Greenhouse gas emissions in this table do not include carbon credits.\n[D] We estimated the uncertainty of our 2023 Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from the market-based method to be around\n8%.\nWe undertake external verification of our greenhouse gas emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from assets and\nactivities under our operational control and the emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our net carbon\nintensity have been verified to a level of limited assurance by LRQA. Limited assurance means nothing has come to the verifier’s attention that\nwould indicate the greenhouse gas data and information, as presented in the Greenhouse Gas Statement/Assertion, were not materially\ncorrect.\nRead our most recent assurance statements atwww.shell.com/ghg.\nNet carbon intensity\nOur target is to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by the following amounts: 9–12% by 2024, 9–13% by 2025,\n15–20% by 2030 and 100% by 2050. We use net carbon intensity to track our progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy\nproducts sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared to a 2016 baseline. It\nreflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low- and zero-carbon products — such as biofuels, hydrogen and\nrenewable electricity. Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and\nour customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.\nIn line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus\non commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than\npreviously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target.\nAs a result, we are now targeting a 15–20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016,\nagainst 20% previously. Read more about our climate targets in ourEnergy Transition Strategy 2024.\nShell’s net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and\nreported using the Net Carbon Footprint methodology. We express our net carbon intensity as the grams of CO2equivalent permegajoule\n(gCO2e/MJ) produced for each unit of energy delivered to, and used by, a consumer.\nIn 2023, Shell’s net carbon intensity was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO2e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from\nthe previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in our net carbon intensity in 2023 was mainly\nachieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven\nmainly by progress in grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe and partly by increased sales of renewable power\nincluding the retirement of renewable energy certificates.\n26 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

The increase was due to venting\n(which includes maintenance at our Prelude floating LNG facility, Australia and operational issues at Sarawak Shell Berhad, Malaysia) and\nhigher reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with\nOil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) reporting requirements. Methane emissions were around 2% of Shell’s greenhouse gas emissions on\na CO2equivalent basis in 2023. More than 65% of our reported methane emissions in 2023 came from flaring and venting in our upstream and\nmidstream operations.\nMethane reduction at Shell-operated and non-operated sites\nWe continue to reduce methane emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive emission sources at\nour operated oil, gas and liquified natural gas production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor\nequipment.\nWe have reduced reported methane emissions by using multiple approaches to detect and prevent emissions, including reduced flaring and\nventing, as well as implementing more accurate methods for calculating emissions. At our QGC natural gas project in Australia, for instance, we\nhave reduced methane emissions from gas dehydration facilities by around 2,800 tonnes since 2017.\nWe also work with our joint ventures to help them develop emission monitoring programmes. We have encouraged our non-operated ventures to\nadopt the voluntary UN-led OGMP 2.0 reporting framework. Many of our non-operated venture partners became signatories to the OGMP\nprogramme in 2023. They include Nigeria LNG, Oman LNG, Atlantic LNG and North Caspian Operating Company.\nWorking with others to reduce methane emissions\nWe encourage industry-wide action on methane emissions reduction by participating in voluntary initiatives.\nFor example, we are a founding signatory of the OGMP 2.0 reporting framework and continue to implement enhanced methane emissions\nmeasurement and reporting. In 2023, we were awarded Gold Standard status for our OGMP 2.0 reporting for the third consecutive year.\nWe participate in other multi-stakeholder groups, such as the Methane Guiding Principles(MGP) coalition, which we initiated in 2017, the Oil &\nGas Climate Initiative and the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative.\nIn 2023, members of the MGP, including Shell, started to engage with governments and companies in 20 countries, informing them about\nmethane policies and regulations and sharing best practice on methane emissions reduction along the gas value chain.\nWe intend to contribute to the World Bank’s Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund to help finance methane emissions detection,\nquantification and abatement projects in low- and middle-income countries.\nShell also signed the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter that was launched at COP28 in 2023.

For remaining emissions, we offer and use high-quality\ncarbon credits, including from nature-based solutions.\nTo help us do that, we invest directly in natural ecosystem projects to increase the supply of carbon credits and help meet growing demand.\nNature-based solutions protect and enhance natural ecosystems ― such as forests, grasslands, wetlands and coastal zones ― or improve\nagricultural sustainability by absorbing or preventing the release of greenhouse gases.\nWe aim to work with or invest in nature-based projects that have robust environmental and social safeguards while also creating net-positive\nimpacts on biodiversity and for local communities. We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards.\nThese include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are\nreal and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered.\nWe also buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we\npurchase and retire from the market.\nOur performance\nIn 2023, which was a turbulent year for the voluntary carbon market, we continued to build a portfolio of high-quality nature-based and non-\nnature-based projects with long-term commitments. We deployed $86 million: $52 million for nature-based projects and $34 million for\ntechnology-based projects that generate carbon credits.\nFor 2023, we retired around21.8 millioncarbon credits, of which20 millioncredits are included in our net carbon intensity and1.8 millioncredits\nare associated mainly with the sale of non-energy products and Shell’s business travel (one carbon credit represents the avoidance or removal of\n1tonne of CO2). These numbers exclude direct carbon trading activities.\nIn 2023, in the USA, we launched Greenline Climate with the Spatial InformaticsGroup to provide development services for projects generating\nforest carbon credits. We also invested in carbon sequestration developer Kateri to help livestock farmers protect and restore grasslands and\nearn carbon credit revenues through sustainable land and grazing management.\nIn India, Shell is providing finance for one of the largest household efficiency programmes globally.

CCS is a combination of technologies that\ncapture and store carbon dioxide deep underground or under the seabed, preventing its release into the atmosphere.\nIn 2023, Shell’s spending on CCS opportunities (operating expenses and cash capital expenditure) amounted to around $340 million, an\nincrease of 55% from $220 million in 2022.\nBy the end of 2023, the Shell-operated Quest CCS project at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely\nstored more than8.8 milliontonnes of CO2since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of increasingCCScapacity at the\nScotford Complex, initially by 750,000tonnes a year, through our proposed Polaris project and Atlas Carbon Sequestration Hub.\nIn Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron), reported it had stored more than9 milliontonnes of CO2\nequivalent as of December 2023. In addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered\ncarbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The joint venture will also invest $27millionin lower-carbon projects in Western Australia.\nGorgon started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the world.\nIn May 2023, our Northern Lights CO2transport and storage joint venture (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed agreements with Yara, the\ncrop nutrition company, and Ørsted, the renewable energy company, to transport and store 830,000tonnes and 430,000tonnes of CO2a\nyear respectively. The CO2will be transported by ship from plants in the Netherlands and Denmark and permanently stored 2,600metres below\nthe seabed in the North Sea. Northern Lights is under construction and is expected to start operations in 2025.\n32 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

In 2023, around9.7 billionlitres of biofuels went into Shell’s petrol and diesel\nworldwide, compared with9.5 billionlitres in 2022. This included around3.4 billionlitres through our joint venture Raízen (Shell interest 44%,\nnot Shell-operated) in Brazil, compared with about3 billionlitres in 2022.\nRaízen is one of the world’s biggest bioethanol producers, producing some of the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. In 2023,\nRaízen produced around3.1 billionlitres of ethanol from sugar cane and30 millionlitres of second-generation cellulosic ethanol made from\ninedible agricultural waste. Raízen also commissioned in 2023 the first of eight world-scale advanced biofuel plants which it aims to build in\nBrazil.\nTo support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks. We have invested in agroforestry company Investancia\nGroup. Investancia is reforesting degraded cattle land in Paraguay with pongamia oil trees and native trees to provide sustainable feedstock for\nbiofuels, along with additional protein for animal feed markets.

We also started work on more\nthan 270 R&D projects with universities, compared with more than 250 in 2022.\nOur R&D activities are key to achieving our net-zero emissions target. In 2023, our R&D expenditure on projects that contributed to\ndecarbonisation was around$628 million, representing about 49% of our total R&D spend, compared with around 41% in 2022. This includes\nexpenditure on reducing greenhouse gas emissions:\nfrom our own operations, for example, by improving energy efficiency and electrification;\nfrom the fuels and other products we sell to our customers — for example, biofuels, synthetic fuels and products made from low-carbon\nelectricity, and hydrogen produced using renewable sources;\nby carbon capture, utilisation and storage applied to hydrogen production from natural gas and other carbon emissions;\nby researching nature-based solutions to offset emissions; and\nfor our customers through renewable power generation, storage, e-mobility and other electrification solutions.\nExamples of R&D areas other than decarbonisation include safety, performance products such as lubricants and polymers, and the integration of\nrobotics, automation and artificial intelligence.\nInnovations in 2023\nIn 2023, Shell won an order for its CANSOLV®carbon capture technology for the world’s largest post-combustion carbon capture, utilisation\nand storage facility. The facility, in Abu Dhabi, UAE, will capture and permanently store1.5 milliontonnes of CO2a year at a gas processing\nplant, helping Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to decarbonise its operations (see alsoCarbon capture and storage).\nWe also took the decision to build a direct air capture demonstration unit in the USA to prove the technical viability of our solid sorbent\ntechnology, which removes carbon dioxide from the air. The CO2could then be stored permanently underground or reused as feedstock in the\nproduction of chemicals and fuels.\nIn China, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system at our Zhuhai plant, which produces lubricants and greases. The system replaces\ndiesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate process steam for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production\nand is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300tonnes and CO2emissions by more than 900tonnes annually.\nAs part of our commitment to develop sustainable biofuels, we have partnered with two leading Brazilian research institutes, Unicamp and Senai\nCimatec, to explore the potential of using agave as a feedstock. Agave is a semi-arid plant that requires minimal amounts of water. By growing it\nin Brazil, we hope to develop a scalable value chain that could significantly reduce emissions.\nRead more about technology and innovation atwww.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-role-technology-plays/technology-for-a-sustainable-\nenergy-industry.\nMore in this reportCarbon capture and storage|Biofuels|Energy efficiency in our operations\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Technology and innovation|Technology for a net zero energy future\n39 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

We recognise there is a growing global urgency to protect and enhance biodiversity,\nconserve fresh water and use resources more efficiently.\nThe links between nature and climate are recognised in the UN Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework of 2022 and in discussions at\nthe 2023 UN Climate Change Conference (COP28). We will work with governments and others to help implement the framework, which\nprovides a common direction and targets for governments to take action to halt and reverse biodiversity loss.\nAs a business, we use natural resources such as land, water and materials for our operations. Our activities can have an impact on nature\nthrough discharges and emissions to the environment, and through changes to the use of land and water including oceans.\nRespecting the environment and local communities has been integral to the way we do business for many years, as set out in the Shell General\nBusiness Principles and Shell Commitment and Policy on Health, Security, Safety, the Environment and Social Performance.\nOur Executive Committee is accountable for delivery of respecting nature, progress towards which is reviewed by our Board’sSustainability\nCommittee (SUSCO).\nOur progress\nFor a large global organisation like Shell, implementing a change programme for respecting nature has many elements and is a multi-year\njourney. Since launch in 2021, we have:\nworked to embed respecting nature into our activities and business processes;\nenhanced our internal performance management systems to track and report on progress; and\ncontinued to build employees’ awareness, knowledge and skills to deepen their understanding of respecting nature.\nWe are also updating our environmental standards and guidance used by our projects and facilities around the world.\nIn 2023, we reviewed our progress and performance on respecting nature.\nWe consolidated our respecting nature ambitions into the following themes: having a positive impact on biodiversity, aiming forzero wasteand\nusing water, other resources and materials efficiently.\nWe have already achieved some of the commitments we set when we launched respecting nature in 2021. Our commitment to reduce fresh-\nwater consumption in highly water-stressed areas by 15% was achieved ahead of the target date of 2025. We have also conducted detailed\nassessments to inform our approach to fresh water and waste, which will be tailored to local conditions.\nWe have concluded that the scale of our ambition to use1 milliontonnes of plastic waste a year in our global chemical plants by 2025 is\nunfeasible due to lack of available plastic waste feedstock, slow technology development and regulatory uncertainty. We continue to work with\npartners across the plastic waste value chain, such as the waste management industry and pyrolysis oil producers, to help develop a circular\nvalue chain globally (seePlastics).\nThe remaining commitments announced in 2021 have either been incorporated into our new Safety, Environment and Asset Management\n(SEAM) Standards, which take effect from mid-2024, or are included in the relevant business objectives and processes.\nOur approach, ambition and priorities are shown in the graphic below.\nYou can read more in the other respecting nature sections and more about our approach atwww.shell.com/sustainability/environment.\n41 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

It includes providing the\nenergy people need, championing inclusion, respecting human rights and contributing to local communities.\nPeople’s lives are better with energy. It provides warmth and light, cooked food and transport. We deliver this for millions of people around the\nworld every day and are working to provide energy to those who do not yet have it.\nWe also want to help communities benefit from having us as their neighbour. We generate jobs, pay billions in tax each year and support start-\nups, local businesses and education programmes. And we promote human rights in the communities, companies and organisations we work with.\nThis includes activities such as advancing worker welfare and shaping an inclusive world so that everyone can be themselves.\nEmbedding a people-centred approach\nRespecting people has been integral to the way we do business for many years. Shell’s HSSE & SP Control Framework [A] sets out how we\nidentify, assess and manage our impacts on communities where we operate, including any impact on human rights. The framework also defines\nhow we should share the benefits arising from our presence, such as by providing local employment and contractual opportunities.\n[A] We are transitioning from theHSSE & SPControl Framework to our new Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards as part of the Shell Performance Framework. The\nSEAMStandards will come into effect in mid-2024.\nAs part of our aim to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world, ourCEOand Executive Committee are\naccountable for our progress against our diversity, equity and inclusion goals.\nThe importance of respecting people also extends to our suppliers. Shell’s Supplier Principles outline our expectations for business integrity,\nincluding safety, security, labour and human rights, and environmental and social performance. We expect all suppliers to understand and\nimplement the principles in their supply chains when working with Shell.\nOpen dialogue\nOur commitment to continuous improvement means we have several mechanisms to encourage people to raise issues of concern. This includes\nthe opportunity to report them anonymously through, for example, the Shell Global Helpline; and our community feedback mechanism and\nnetwork of 148 community engagement practitioners, who act as a bridge between the communities where we operate and our activities. We\nalso have reporting mechanisms for workers to speak freely about injustices or poor facilities. By encouraging people to raise their concerns and\nideas for improvement, we hope to make a positive impact on people’s lives and livelihoods.\nMore in this reportProviding lower-carbon electricity|Letter from the CEO|Our Powering Progress targets\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Working with communities|Diversity, equity and inclusion\nProviding access to energy\nAround760 millionpeople in the world have no electricity, according to the International Energy Agency [A], and millions more have unreliable\npower supply.\n[A] International Energy Agency, SDG7: Data and Projections, 2023.\nShell works to bring a reliable and affordable supply of electricity to those who do not have it. We do this commercially, by investing in\nbusinesses that supply energy access in emerging markets; and socially, by investing funds and expertise in access to energy programmes.\nInvesting in energy access\nThrough our commercial investments, we are working to improve the reliability of existing power supply to on-grid customers and to provide first\npower to off-grid customers and communities.\nWe are seeking strategic partnerships with governments, utilities, developers, banks and investors to address local challenges and opportunities.\nIn 2022, we acquired Daystar Power, a provider of solar power to businesses in West Africa. The investment helps expand our energy business\ninto developing markets like those in Africa where more low-carbon electricity is needed. Daystar is now expanding its operations into South\nAfrica. Daystar Power is present in seven countries and runs more than 400 power installations. It has installed more than 50 megawatts of solar\npower for commercial and industrial customers.\nIn 2024, we took a further step towards providing access to energy for those without.

Through these voluntary\ninitiatives, we work with partner organisations to help individuals and communities access reliable electricity.\nIn 2023, we continued to implement programmes to improve access to energy. Through these programmes, around 42,000 people — in India,\nMalaysia, the Philippines and South Africa — gained access to either electricity or improved cooking conditions. The programmes also provide\nmicro-enterprises with reliable supplies of renewable electricity to power equipment that can generate income, such as water pumps, welding\nmachines or refrigerators to keep agricultural produce fresh.\nFor instance, in India, we partnered with Care India to promote the use of improved cooking solutions in 25 villages in South Gujarat. Around\n5,800 households, two-thirds of those reached by the project, are now using an improved cookstove, compared with none before the project.\nAnd in Nigeria, we worked with Pact in 2022 and 2023 to help micro-enterprises switch from diesel generators to electric motors to power their\nbusinesses. The project enabled a 30% reduction in energy consumption and a 60% increase in recorded income.\nRead more about how our social investment programmes help to increase access to energy atwww.shell.com/sustainability/communities/\naccess-to-energy.\nMore in this reportProviding lower-carbon electricity|Letter from the CEO|Our Powering Progress targets\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Working with communities|Local employment and enterprise\nWorking with our suppliers\nSupply chain\nOur standard contract terms require adherence to the Shell Supplier Principles or equivalent principles that include statements on\ncomplying with environmental laws and regulations, using energy and natural resources efficiently, and minimising waste, emissions and\ndischarges.

The team is supported by functions such as Shell Health, Human\nResources, Real Estate, and IT.\nWe are also providing a better experience for our customers with physical disabilities through an app, delivered by fuelService, that allows any\ncustomer with a disability to alert stations in advance and request assistance. As of December 2023, Shell offered the service at more than\n8,250 stations in 10 countries.

Internal and external\nresearch shows that increased employee engagement results in better business performance and improved safety. In 2023, the response rate to\nthe survey was 88% (up from 87% in 2022). The average employee engagement score was unchanged at 79% from the 2022 level, which is top\nquartile in comparison with external benchmarks. This score does not include responses from the joint-venture partners who participated\nvoluntarily in the Shell People Survey.\nAcross Shell, employees have access to the Executive Committee, senior leaders, local employee forums and employee resource groups. These\nengagements enable Shell to maintain a constructive employee and industrial relations environment.\nManagement regularly engages with employees through elected employee representatives and a range of local formal and informal channels.\nThese channels include webcasts and all-employee messages from our CEO and other senior leaders, as well as town halls, team meetings and\nsite visits by the Board and senior management.\nWe respect the right to collective bargaining and freedom of association. Shell respects local law in our efforts to advancelabour principles.\nWhere appropriate, engagement takes place with union representatives at asset and country level, as well as with the Shell European Works\nCouncil. In 2023, all our employees had access to an independent channel to raise their employment concerns or grievances. This includes the\nShell Global Helpline, unions and local employee forums.\nMore in this reportRespecting human rights|Ethical leadership|Our Powering Progress targets\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|DE&I awards and recognition|Shell in the UK Diversity Pay Gap Report\n57 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

This helps raise expectations\nand levels of consistency across the industry. Our approach is based on the 10 Building Responsibly Worker Welfare Principles.\nWe continue to take steps to improve our approach, and that of our industry, to worker welfare. In 2023, we worked closely with Ipieca to co-\ncreate a programme to improve ethical recruitment and worker engagement in the oil and gas industry, which will be piloted in 2024.\nIn 2023, we worked with bp, Equinor and Ørsted to improve the rights and welfare of migrant workers in our supply chains. As a first step, the\ncompanies drafted a set of principles and guidelines in consultation with suppliers and civil society organisations. The aim is to improve\naccommodation and transport for migrant workers; adopt the principle that the employer, not the worker, should pay the cost of recruitment; and\nimplement effective grievance mechanisms. The next step, starting in 2024, is to pilot the principles and guidelines in fabrication yards in\nSingapore.\nAn important part of our activities is to encourage workers to speak freely about injustices or poor facilities, anonymously if they wish. At our\nShell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore, we conducted a survey of more than 400 workers employed by 15 contractor partners, which was\nheld over four days in seven languages. The initiative resulted in improvements to dormitories and rest areas and the construction of safe bridges\nand walkways.\nDuring the year, our senior leadership visited worksites and accommodation in Singapore, Oman, Qatar and many other countries to engage\nwith and listen to contract workers. We have found that site visits by senior Shell leadership help create a culture of trust, care and inclusion,\nespecially among migrant workers employed by our partner companies.\nTwo of the issues raised by contractor workers at some sites, and in our industry as a whole, are payment of recruitment fees and the late\npayment of salaries. In 2023, we remedied late payment of contractor workers’ salaries in Nigeria. We continue to work on both issues.\nIn 2023, senior executives from Shell’s 23 major global contractors joined Shell executives in Norway for our annual Contractor Safety\nLeadership workshop. Areas of discussion were worker welfare and human rights, mental health, and technology solutions for safer work at the\nfrontline.\nAlso in 2023, leadership teams from 25 Shell joint ventures and companies newly acquired by Shell met in the Netherlands to discuss topics\nsuch as worker welfare and to affirm support for industry efforts on worker welfare. We believe that the welfare of our workers is vital to enable\nthem to perform safely at their best.\nOur efforts to improve worker welfare are under continuous development. We continue to work on our salient human rights issues, including\nlabour rights in the workplace. Our aim is to be transparent about our progress as well as the challenges we face in our operations and supply\nchain.\nRead more about worker welfare atwww.shell.com/sustainability/communities/worker-welfare.\nMore in this reportWorking with our suppliers|Diversity, equity and inclusion|Our Powering Progress targets|Respecting human rights\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Human rights|Shell's approach to human rights (pdf)\nRespecting human rights\nOur approach to human rights\nHuman rights are fundamental to Shell’s core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. Respect for human rights is embedded in the\nShell General Business PrinciplesandShell Code of Conduct. Shell is committed to respecting human rights as set out in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our\napproach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\nWe work closely with various organisations to improve how we apply theUNguiding principles.\nSalient human rights\nIn 2023, we continued to work on our salient human rights issues (salient human rights are those that are most at risk from our operations). We\nprioritise four focus areas where respect for human rights is critical to how we operate: at the workplace including labour rights, in supply chains,\ncommunities, and security.\nShell employees working in these focus areas need to complete mandatory human rights training. About 1,750employees had completed the\ntraining between its launch in 2021 and the end of 2023, which is 94% of those assigned the training. We encourage all employees to do the\ncourse, regardless of their role, to build greater understanding of human rights across Shell.\n58 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

When procuring solar panels and modules for our projects, for example, we\nengage extensively with our suppliers to promote transparency and understand human rights risks in our supply chain. (See theWorker Welfare\nandIndigenous Peoplessections.)\nWe also continue to track emerging human rights and environmental due diligence legislation, and advance our efforts to strengthen human\nrights-related controls in our supply chain.

We take steps to have clear and\nplanned responses to security incidents, so that we are able to react quickly and effectively if they occur.\nShell is a member of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR) initiative. This is a multi-stakeholder initiative of\ngovernments, extractive sector industries and non-governmental organisations that gives guidance on how to respect human rights, while\nproviding security for business operations. Shell implements this guidance across its companies, concentrating on countries where the risks of\nworking with state and private security forces are identified as greatest.\nWe carry out annual risk assessments and develop implementation plans to manage the identified risks. As part of these plans, we carry out\ntraining and awareness briefings with the security forces that we rely on in our implementation countries. We also screen private security\nproviders on VPSHR and monitor their performance against a range of criteria.\n59 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

We seek the support and agreement of Indigenous Peoples potentially affected by our activities through\ndialogue, culturally appropriate grievance mechanisms and impact management processes.\nShell has a public position statement on Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), a principle recognised in the UN Declaration on the Rights of\nIndigenous Peoples. It entails open dialogue, good-faith negotiations and, where appropriate, the development of agreements that address the\nneeds of Indigenous Peoples.\nFor instance, in Peru, we are a partner in “Living Forests Forever”, a REDD+ [A] project that Shell is funding and that is operated by Aider, a non-\ngovernmental organisation. The project aims to conserve Amazonian forests through communal forest management and strengthen local\nbusinesses to improve the quality of life of local Indigenous Peoples. Key principles that guide the project are the demarcation of indigenous\nterritories and the inclusion of the indigenous communities in the project management committee along with Shell and Aider.\n[A] REDD+ is a framework created by the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties to guide activities that reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.\nIn Canada, Shell’s Scotford Complex signed a Good Neighbour Agreement with its two closest indigenous communities, the Enoch Cree Nation\nand the Alexander First Nation. The agreement is a commitment to open doors, learn from one another, and build stronger commercial and\ncultural partnerships, including integrating First Nation businesses into Shell’s supply chain (seeLocal content).\nRead more about our approach to Indigenous Peoples at www.shell.com/sustainability/communities/working-with-communities.\nMore in this reportCommunity skills and enterprise development|Respecting human rights|Contributing to communities\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Local employment and enterprise|Human rights|Shell's approach to human rights (pdf)\nCultural heritage\nPreserving cultural heritage is an important part of our efforts to manage our social impact. Cultural heritage refers to places of archaeological,\nhistorical, cultural, artistic and religious significance. It also includes the preservation of unique environmental features, cultural knowledge and\ntraditional lifestyles.\nOur approach starts with considering how to avoid or minimise our impact on cultural heritage. This can involve carrying out archaeological\nassessments to inform, among other things, project design and site selection. We then develop chance-find procedures to deal with previously\nunknown heritage resources that may be discovered during construction. We train staff and contractors to make them fully aware of these\nresources to give them the authority to halt work if necessary.\nIn Albania, for instance, where we began exploring for oil in 2019, our pre-drilling impact assessments identified unknown sites of cultural\nimportance, some of which date back more than 2,000years. We suspended our activities to allow local experts to excavate and find out more.\nThis led to significant finds of importance for Albania’s past.

We aim to avoid resettlement\nwherever possible. Where resettlement is unavoidable, we work with local communities to help them resettle and maintain, or improve, their standard of\nliving in accordance with international standards for resettlement (notably the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standard 5 on land\nacquisition and involuntary resettlement). Our support may also include helping these communities to establish alternative livelihoods.\nIn Tanzania, Shell and Equinor — alongside their partners ExxonMobil, Pavilion Energy and MedcoEnergi — are supporting families that vacated\na site in 2021 acquired by the national oil company for a proposed gas and liquefied natural gas development. The partners are providing in-\nkind support to supplement statutory government financial compensation and address residual impacts such as the loss of farmland. In 2023, the\npartners launched an agricultural assistance programme to help restore the living standards and livelihoods of the affected households. This was\nbased on extensive surveys and the active involvement of the families, village leaders, regional and local authorities, and non-governmental\norganisations. Additional support measures are planned.\nWe understand that offshore activities can impact local fishermen and that action through the relevant industry associations is an effective way\nto manage and mitigate potential impacts. In 2023, we helped develop a new Ipieca guide for fishing baselines to identify, avoid or mitigate the\npotential impacts of offshore projects on fishing livelihoods and dependent communities.\nRead more about our approach to involuntary resettlement atwww.shell.com/sustainability/communities/working-with-communities.\nMore in this reportCommunity skills and enterprise development|Respecting human rights|Contributing to communities\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Local employment and enterprise|Human rights|Shell's approach to human rights (pdf)\n62 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

In 2023, we made progress in supporting a just transition across a range of themes, including skills\ntraining, trialling a new model to share profits with local communities and improving energy access.\nSkills for the future\nAs more jobs are created in renewable energy, people working in oil and gas may wish or need to acquire new skills.\nIn 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees — up from around 4,000 in 2022 — completed courses linked to the energy transition, including\nhydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management.\nIn the UK, we aim to help 15,000 people into jobs with a focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, along with its partners, is supporting the\ncreation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to\nprovide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation.\nCommunities\nAt our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the proceeds of the renewable energy\nwe generate. Over the next 16years, we expect to pay around$2 millioninto a special community fund to be used as the community sees best.\nIn 2024, we pledged$200 millionas part of a broader initiative to help people get access to energy in the near and medium term. The initiative\naims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-east Asia get access to electricity and\nimproved cooking conditions (as defined by the World Bank Multi-Tier Framework).\nIn Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed toinvest$11 millionin 25 mini-grid projectsacross the country. The company\naims to finance affordable solar energy for communities that need it the most.\nHuman rights, governments and industry\nRespecting human rights is an essential part of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\nThis includes our commitment to managing human rights issues that are central to the just transition, including, but not limited to, the rights of\nIndigenous Peoples; Free, Prior and Informed Consent; and access to remedy.\nWe also work with organisations to review how we embed just transition principles across our businesses. Opportunities to collaborate will be an\nimportant part of our approach. We continue to be actively involved in Energy for a Just Transition, which is run by Business for Social\nResponsibility and The B Team, and Ipieca’s Just Transition Task Force.\nLearn howShell’s tax contribution to governmentsand proposal on fiscal frameworks for the energy transition can contribute to a just and\nequitable energy transition.\nRead more about our approach atwww.shell.com/justtransition.\n63 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

In 2023, we implemented projects to\nreduce flaring at our PearlGTLgas-to-liquids facility in Qatar, increase electrification of our sites in Canada and the Netherlands, and vent less\nmethane at our QGC facility in Australia.\nRead more about our approach atwww.shell.com/what-we-do/oil-and-natural-gasand in our2023 Annual Report.\nLiquefied natural gas\nShell is a leading liquefied natural gas(LNG) supplier with diverse sources of LNG from different regions, alongside extensive shipping and\nstorage assets and access to regasification plants.\nLNG serves both energy security and the energy transition. Natural gas generates electricity, heating and cooling for industries, homes and\nbusinesses, and it provides grid stability and flexibility which enable continued growth for wind and solar energy in power generation.\nLNG plays an important role in hard-to-electrify sectors like shipping and heavy-duty road transport, where it can reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions by up to 23% and 22% respectively from production to use compared with conventional fuels.\nAs one of the world’s largest suppliers of LNG, we are able to ship natural gas to where it is needed most.\nShell has access to almost40 milliontonnes of capacity through its interests in 11 liquefaction plants. We are growing our portfolio by a third\nwith around11 milliontonnes a year of new LNG capacity under construction, which will come on stream in the second half of this decade.\nWe are also working with our joint-venture partners to reduce the emissions intensity of our LNG projects. LNG Canada (Shell interest 40%),\nwhich is expected to start production later this decade, is designed to have the lowest carbon intensity of any large liquefaction facility currently\noperating anywhere in the world ― about 60% lower than the average facility today and 35% lower than the best-performing facility.\nWe are partners in the North Field East and North Field South expansion projects in Qatar which will supply markets worldwide and include\ncarbon capture and storage to reduce emissions.\nRead more about liquefied natural gas atwww.shell.com/what-we-do/oil-and-natural-gas/liquefied-natural-gas-lng..\nConventional oil and gas\nWe have conventional oil and gas operations in 15 countries, onshore and offshore, at various stages of the life cycle and with varying degrees\nof size and complexity. Our Upstream business aims to keep liquids production (crude oil and natural gas liquids) levels flat, while delivering\nlower-carbon oil.\nIn 2023, we delivered first gas from the Timi unmanned platform (Shell interest 75%) off the coast of Sarawak in Malaysia. Timi is powered by\nwind and solar energy and is around 60% lighter than a conventional wellhead platform powered by oil and gas.\nRead more about our approach atwww.shell.com/what-we-do/oil-and-natural-gas.\nDeep water\nShell has a long history of using its knowledge, experience and proven deep-water technologies to unlock energy resources safely and efficiently.\nIn the US Gulf of Mexico, we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest greenhouse gas intensities in the world for producing oil,\ncompared with other oil and gas producing members of the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers. Our latest Shell-operated\ndevelopment, Vito (Shell interest 63.1%), started production in 2023. Vito is a third the size of its original design, which is expected to reduce\nCO2emissions by around 80% over its operating life. We are using the same design concept for our Shell-operated Whale facility (Shell interest\n60%) and Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) in the US Gulf of Mexico, which are expected to start production in late 2024 and 2028\nrespectively. Sparta will also feature all-electric topside compression equipment, significantly reducing greenhouse gas intensity and emissions\nfrom our own operations.\nRead more about Shell’s deep-water operations around the world atwww.shell.com/what-we-do/oil-and-natural-gas/deep-water.\n66 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

We hold one licence interest in the North Slope area of Alaska. We also\nhold several licences from our previous activities in the Canadian Arctic, although we do not plan to develop these licences.\nIn Norway, Shell is a 10% partner in Irpa, an offshore natural gas discovery in the Norwegian Sea, which is ice-free all year round.\nFor more information visitwww.shell.com/what-we-do/oil-and-natural-gas/exploration/arctic-regions.\nMore in this reportOur Powering Progress targets|Letter from the CEO|Energy transition in action\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Integrating sustainability into our activities|Embedding sustainability in our major projects\nEmbedding sustainability into our activities\nProjects\nSafety and the impact of our activities on the environment and communities are vital considerations when we plan, design and operate our\nprojects and facilities. We want to help communities benefit from having us as their neighbour by generating jobs, supporting local businesses\nand promoting human rights and worker welfare.\nThe mandatory requirements in our Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social Performance (HSSE & SP) Control Framework [A] help to\nensure projects and facilities are designed and constructed safely, responsibly and in a consistent way.\n[A] We are transitioning from the HSSE & SP Control Framework to our new Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards as part of the Shell Performance Framework.\nTheSEAM Standards will come into effect in mid-2024.\nRespecting nature is embedded as a core business principle across our portfolio of projects globally. It extends across the entire lifespan of the\nfacility, from design, engineering and construction to operation over many decades and decommissioning.\nAssessing climate-related risks is an important part of our decision to invest in a project. Projects under development that are expected to have a\nmaterial greenhouse gas impact must meet our internal carbon performance standards or industry benchmarks. This aims to ensure that our\nprojects can compete and prosper in the energy transition.\nPotential new projects are screened to determine if they are located in a critical habitat or result in deforestation. If we decide to proceed with a\nproject located in a critical habitat, we develop a biodiversity action plan. This sets out actions needed to follow the mitigation hierarchy and,\nwhere there is impact, the actions needed to achieve a net positive impact.\nIn 2023, we started gas production at the unmanned Timi (Shell interest 75%) offshore platform in Malaysia, which is powered by solar and\nwind energy and is around 60% lighter than a conventional wellhead platform powered by oil and gas. In the US Gulf of Mexico, our latest\nShell-operated development, Vito (Shell interest 63.1%), started production in 2023. Vito is a third the size of its original design, which is\nexpected to reduce CO2emissions by around 80% over its operating life. We are using the same design concept for our Shell-operated Whale\nfacility (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) in the US Gulf of Mexico, which are expected to start production in late 2024\nand 2028 respectively. Sparta will also feature all-electric topside compression equipment, significantly reducing greenhouse gas intensity and\nemissions from our own operations.\nRead more about how we embed sustainability into the life of a project atwww.shell.com/sustainability/embedding-sustainability-into-projects.\nRead about our major projects atwww.shell.com/about-us/major-projects.\nDecommissioning and restoration\nDecommissioning is part of the normal life cycle of every oil and gas structure. We work hard to close and dispose of installations in a safe,\nefficient, cost-effective and environmentally responsible manner. This includes restoring the surroundings of platforms and facilities in line with\nrelevant legislation, while taking our own environmental standards into account.\n67 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

We seek to reuse,\nrepurpose and recycle materials in decommissioning. At the end of 2023, we reported$19 billionon our balance sheet for current and non-\ncurrent decommissioning and other provisions, which is how we account for future decommissioning expenses (see our2023 Annual Report).\nShell invests in innovative decommissioning and restoration technologies, both in-house and by funding third parties. For instance, in the\nNetherlands, we have developed technology to deep-clean hazardous contaminants from unused pipelines. This allows us to sell the pipelines\nfor reuse, such as for piping hydrogen, or recycle them and deliver on our ambitions of circularity.\nRead more about Shell’s approach to decommissioning atwww.shell.com/sustainability/decommissioning-and-restoration.\nMore in this reportOur Powering Progress targets|Letter from the CEO|Energy transition in action\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Integrating sustainability into our activities|The Brent Story\nNon-operated ventures\nMore than half of Shell’s joint ventures are not operated by Shell. We do not have direct control over how these ventures embed sustainability in\ntheir operations. We seek instead to offer our support and exert a positive influence on their operations.\nWe expect a joint venture not operated by Shell to apply standards and processes, or principles, that are substantially equivalent to our own,\nspecifically our:\nShell General Business Principles;\nShell Commitment and Policy on Health, Safety, Security, the Environment and Social Performance; and\nStatement on Risk Management (or a materially equivalent approach to risk and internal control).\nIn 2023, as part of our efforts to enhance transparency and the robustness of our methane emissions data reporting, we held sessions with\nseveral joint-venture partners to discuss the importance of methane emissions management, technical knowledge transfer and the benefits of the\nOil & Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework, of which we are a founding signatory. Several of our joint-venture partners\nsubsequently joined the OGMP 2.0 programme. During the year, we were awarded Gold Standard status for our OGMP 2.0 reporting for the\nthird consecutive year.\nShell is a non-operating partner in Basrah Gas Company (BGC, Shell interest 44%), an Iraqi joint venture that is one of the largest flare reduction\nprojects in the world. BGC’s sole purpose is to capture gas that would otherwise be flared from three giant oil fields operated by other\ncompanies. Since it started operations in 2013, BGC’s gas capture has tripled to more than1 billioncubic feetper day, which is 63% of the gas\nproduced from the fields. The aim is to capture more than 90% of the gas by 2028.\nFor more information about how we work with our joint ventures, seewww.shell.com/sustainability/integrating-sustainability-into-our-activities/\nworking-with-nonoperated-ventures.\nMore in this reportSustainability at Shell|Our standards and policies|Methane emissions\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Integrating sustainability into our activities\nAcquisitions and divestments\nWe take care to invest and divest responsibly and screen our transactions against multiple criteria.\nBefore acquiring or divesting a business, we assess the counterparty’s financial strength; operating culture; policies governing health, safety,\nsecurity and environmental performance; ethics and compliance; and where relevant, the effectiveness of its social performance programmes.\nWhen applicable, we also share our emission reduction plans for divestments, including how we seek to comply with regulations and implement\nour commitments, for the buyer’s consideration as they prepare to take over ownership.\nRead more about how we acquire and divest atwww.shell.com/sustainability/integrating-sustainability-into-our-activities/acquisitions-and-\ndivestments.\nMore in this reportSustainability at Shell|Energy transition in action|Our standards and policies\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|Integrating sustainability into our activities\n68 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

We support\ntransparency and share information and data in this report and onwww.shell.com.\nThere are inherent limitations to the accuracy of environmental, safety and social performance data. We recognise that our data will be affected\nby these limitations, so we continue to improve data integrity by strengthening our internal controls.\nWe provide all non-financial data in this report on a 100% basis for companies and joint ventures where we are the operator unless otherwise\nstated, in line with industry practice. We believe that the operational control boundary best reflects existing regulatory requirements, as well as\ninternal policies, for the management of potential health, safety, environmental and social impacts.\nOur Scope1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using two boundaries: operational control and equity. Under the operational\ncontrol boundary, we report 100% of greenhouse gas emissions from the assets that we operate, regardless of how much equity we have in\nthose assets. Under the equity boundary, we report the greenhouse gas emissions that correspond to our proportion of equity in both operated\nand non-operated assets. Scope1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions under the equity boundary for 2023 are expected to be published later in\nthe year as an update to this report and on our corporate website.\nOperations that we acquired or divested during 2023 are included only for the period in which we operated those assets.\nEmployees in portfolio companies are not included in most human resources data, except for the metrics reflecting total employee numbers,\nactual number of employees by geography, percentage of women employees, and certain mandatory training courses. We refer to the number\nof people employed on a full- and part-time basis. This includes people working in Shell subsidiaries, Shell-operated joint ventures and those\nseconded to non-Shell-operated joint operations, or ventures and associates.\nOther data are collected from external sources, employee surveys and other internal sources as indicated. Some data in the social performance\ndata table come from an internal survey completed by the senior Shell representative in each country. The accuracy of environmental and social\ndata may be lower than that of data obtained through our financial systems.\nWe only include data in this report for 2023 that were confirmed by the end of February 2024. If incidents are reclassified or confirmed, or if\nsignificant data changes occur after preparation of this report, they will be updated the following year.\nAssurance\nWe have clear standards and reporting requirements for our health, safety, security, environment and social performance (HSSE & SP)\ndata.Shell companies are required to adopt these standards, which define management roles and responsibilities, the scope of data at facilities\nand how data are calculated and collected. These standards are part of our HSSE & SP Control Framework [A].\n[A] We are transitioning to our new Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards, which come into effect from July 1, 2024. The standards are part of the Shell Performance\nFramework, which is the overarching framework adopted by Shell to deliver on its strategy. Implementation of migration to the SEAM Standards, pursuant to guidance on expectations and\nprocess,will continue throughout 2024 into 2025.\nTo ensure we provide accurate information, our assurance process for HSSE & SP data is also a key element of the HSSE & SP Control\nFramework. Some examples of the assurance mechanisms in this process are:\nself-assessments at the facility level;\ninternal audits at all levels of Shell;\nquarterly reviews and assessments of the data at all levels;\nan annual series of meetings between leaders at Group level and senior business managers to discuss outcomes and reporting\nparameters;and\nformal sign-off by Shell’s senior country leaders.\nThe Carbon Reporting Committee, which was formed in 2021, is tasked with ensuring thatGroup-level greenhouse gas emission measures —\nabsolute emissions and carbon intensity, and associated metrics — comply with all regulatory and legal requirements.\nThe Report Review Panel of independent experts helps to ensure our reporting is balanced, relevant and responsive to stakeholder interests.\nLRQA has provided limited assurance of our net carbon intensity (measured and reported using the Net Carbon Footprint methodology),\nScope1 and Scope2 greenhouse gas emissions data under operational control for 2023, and Scope3 greenhouse gas emissions from energy\nproducts included in our net carbon intensity.Limited assurance means nothing has come to the verifier’s attention that would indicate the\ngreenhouse gas data and information, as presented in the Net Carbon Intensity Assertion and the Greenhouse Gas Statement/Assertion, were\nnot materially correct. The most recent assurance statements are available atwww.shell.com/ghg.\nConversions into US and Canadian dollars are based on the average exchange rates for 2023.\nMore in this reportOur Powering Progress targets|Our standards and policies|Letter from the CEO\nMore on Shell websitesOur approach|GHG assurance statements\n70 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

Business-specific methodologies for net volumes have been applied to oil products, pipeline gas and power. Paper trades that do\nnot result in physical product delivery are excluded. Retail sales volumes from markets where Shell operates under trademark licensing agreements are also excluded from the scope of\nShell’s net carbon intensity metric.\n[B] Acquisitions and divestments are included in the actual performance tracking with the target and baseline year unchanged. Note that acquisitions and divestments could have a material\nimpact on meeting the targets.\n[C] Percentage of delivered energy may not add up to 100% because of rounding.\n[D] Total volume of energy products sold by Shell, aggregated on an energy basis, with electricity represented as fossil equivalents. This value is derived from energy product sales figures\ndisclosed by Shell in the Annual Report and the Sustainability Report.\n[E] Lower heating values are used for the energy content of the different products. A fossil-equivalence approach is used to account for electrical energy, in order to assess electrical energy\non the same basis as our other energy products.\n[F] Total CO2e emissions estimated using Shell's Net Carbon Footprint value and the estimate of total delivered energy. Note, this estimated value is calculated from the portfolio average\nintensity value, which is determined in Shell's Net Carbon Footprint calculation. Total CO2e emissions are only intended to give an indication of the scope of the emissions included within\nShell's Net Carbon Footprint and do not represent an inventory of emissions. Carbon offsets were included in the total estimated GHG emissions covered by the Net Carbon Footprint\ncalculation.\n[G] These numbers include well-to-wheel emissions associated with energy products sold by Shell, on an equity boundary basis; they also include the well-to-tank emissions associated with the\nmanufacturing of energy products by others that are sold by Shell. Emissions associated with the manufacturing and use of non-energy products are excluded.\n[H] Emissions included in the carbon intensity of power have been calculated using the market-based method.\n[I] The carbon intensity of biofuels reflects the global average for biofuels sold by Shell for 2023.\n76 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

The data are\ncalculated using locally regulated methods where they exist. Where there is no locally regulated method, the data are calculated using the 2021 API Compendium, which is the\nrecognised industry standard under the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. There are inherent limitations to the accuracy of such data. Oil and gas industry\nguidelines (Ipieca, API and IOGP) indicate that several sources of uncertainty can contribute to the overall uncertainty of a corporate emissions inventory. We have estimated the overall\nuncertainty for our direct GHG emissions to be around 4% for 2023.\n[B] 2023 GHG emissions were calculated using global warming potential (GWP) factors from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Data from prior years were calculated using GWP factors\nfrom the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. For comparison, our Scope1 emissions would have been 50 million tonnes in 2023 if we were to use GWPs from the IPCC Fourth Assessment\nReport.\n[C] GHG emissions in this table do not include carbon credits.\n[D] Split by business or country may not add up to the total due to rounding.\n[E] Scope 1 emissions by business for 2019 to 2022 have been restated to reflect the combination of the Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses into a single Integrated Gas and Upstream\nDirectorate, and the Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses into a new Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Directorate in July 2023.\n[F] Includes the Scotford Upgrader and Quest carbon capture and storage. Excludes CO2captured and sequestered by Quest, but Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from operating Quest are\nincluded.\n[G] Includes emissions from other downstream assets and activities (e.g. shipping, lubricants, Trading and Supply, and Renewables and Energy Solutions).\n[H] Includes emissions from assets and activities reported by the Projects & Technology business and Global Functions.\n[I] 2023 methane emissions were converted to CO2equivalents using GWPs from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Data from prior years were calculated using GWP factors from the IPCC\nFourth Assessment Report. For comparison, our methane emissions would have been 1.0 million tonnes in CO2equivalents in 2023 if we were to use GWPs from the IPCC Fourth\nAssessment Report.\n[J] Includes Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses.\n[K] Calculated as total hydrocarbons flared divided by the sum of total oil and gas wellhead production, LNG and GTL production x 100%.\n[L] GHG emissions related to energy production (in the form of electricity, heat or steam) exported to another facility or the public grid. This metric is a subset of our Scope1 GHG emissions.\n78 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

In this report \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes\nused for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our\" are also used to refer to Shell plc\nand its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or\nentities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this report refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The\nterm “joint venture”, “joint operations”, “joint arrangements”, and “associates” may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or\nindirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by\nShell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest.\nForward-looking statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition,\nresults of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and\nunknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements.\nForward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing\nmanagement’s expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and\nphrases such as \"aim\"; \"ambition\"; \"anticipate\"; \"believe\"; “commit”; “commitment”; \"could\"; \"estimate\"; \"expect\"; \"goals\"; \"intend\"; \"may\"; \"milestones\"; \"objectives\";\n\"outlook\"; \"plan\"; \"probably\"; \"project\"; \"risks\"; \"schedule\"; \"seek\"; \"should\"; \"target\"; \"will\"; \"would\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that\ncould affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this\nreport, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d)\ndrilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with\nthe identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business\nin developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures\naddressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and\nrenegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared\ncosts; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and a\nsignificant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous\ndividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred\nto in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell\nplc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available atwww.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filingsand www.sec.gov). These risk factors also\nexpressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of\nthe date of this report, March 19, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking\nstatement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred\nfrom the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nShell’s Net Carbon Intensity\nAlso, in this report we may refer to Shell’s \"Net Carbon Intensity\" (NCI), which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our\nsuppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell.\nShell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only\ncontrols its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s \"Net Carbon Intensity\" or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those\nof Shell plc or its subsidiaries.\nShell’s net-zero emissions target\nShell’s operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and\nwhat we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 andNCItargets over the next ten years. However,\nShell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves\ntowards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be\nsignificant risk that Shell may not meet this target.\nForward-looking non-GAAP measures\nThis report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of\nthese forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparableGAAPfinancial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP\nmeasures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices,\ninterest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is\nextremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the\nmost comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report.\nWe may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) strictly prohibits us from including\nin our filings with theSEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No1-32575, available on theSEC website www.sec.gov.\n94 ShellSustainability Report 2023"

The Accountable person does not necessarily\nimplement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the\naction has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is\nintended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational\nperformance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and\nManuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of ShellGroup strategies and policies.\nCO2compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the\natmosphere. CO2compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower-emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on\nemissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions.\n\"Carbon neutral\" or \"CO2compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO2equivalent to the value of the remaining CO2e\nemissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage/end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the\nproduct are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO2compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have\nbeen generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact.\nCO2e (CO2equivalent) refers to CO2, CH4, N2O.\n95 ShellSustainability Report 2023"
