The Board approves the Company’s\nESG/sustainability strategy and approves its CSV and Sustainability Report for submission to the Annual General Meeting.\nManagement’s role Page 4 The Executive Board is responsible for executing sustainability strategies, including our Net Zero Roadmap, through an ESG & Sustainability Council. At an operational level, an ESG\nStrategy and Deployment Unit drives implementation.\nStrategy\nClimate-related risks and opportunities Pages 9 to 19 Climate change is considered a material risk for Nestlé. Within our Enterprise Risk Management framework, we conduct an annual assessment of climate change risks and review the\nstrategy and plans to mitigate them. We assess related financial risks using a discounted cash flow methodology.\nImpacts of climate-related risks and opportunities Pages 9 to 11\nOur assessment establishes:\nResilience of the organization’s strategy Pages 9 to 11\n– Transition risks: we have assessed transition risks to 2030, based on exposure levels from low-, intermediate- and high-emission pathways. Modeling results show a degree of\nexposure, but our Net Zero Roadmap could reduce this by up to half.\nRisk management – Physical risks: changing temperatures and weather extremes can affect the quality and availability of key raw materials through lower and variable yields, as well as shifts in the\nregions suitable for cultivation. For 12 key ingredients covering 90% of our spend, we estimated the yield change in 2040 versus today in a ‘steady-state', intermediate climate scenario\nProcesses for identifying and assessing climate-related risks Pages 9 to 11\n(+2 to 3 °C by 2100), discounting the unpredictable impacts of extreme events.\nProcesses for managing climate-related risks Pages 9 to 11\nNestlé is well positioned to implement nature-based solutions for less resource-intense and more resilient food production, as it has direct access to more than 500 000 farmers.
